## ⏰ RECOMMENDED TUESDAY MORNING TIMELINE

| Time | Action |
|------|--------|
| **8:30 AM** | Start at **Tropical Coffee Cafe** (Setia Indah) — get iced coffee + espresso |
| **9:00 AM** | Drive to **Lavender/Verbena Bakery** (Taman Pelangi) — macarons, cream puffs, tiramisu, cinnamon rolls, white cake, toast |
| **9:45 AM** | Drive to **Seven Oaks** (Taman Molek) — backup pastries if needed |
| **10:00 AM** | **AEON Tebrau City** or supermarket — fresh berries, milk, any remaining items |
| **10:30 AM** | Pick up **Sienna Patisserie** pre-order if arranged |
| **11:00 AM** | Back at **Dellea Studio** — set up props |
| **12:00 PM** | 📸 SHOOT TIME |

---

## ⚡ ACTION ITEMS (Do BEFORE Tuesday!)

1. **📱 WhatsApp Sienna Patisserie (019-777 1570)** — Pre-order 1-2 pink frosted cupcakes. Explain it's for a photoshoot. Ask about early pickup or delivery to Dellea Studio before 11AM.

2. **📱 Consider WhatsApp Morihana Pastry (+60 16-766 5613)** — They make beautiful petit gateaux. Could pre-order tiramisu slices and fancy pastries if Lavender doesn't have the right look.

3. **📱 Call/WhatsApp Maco Cafe** — If you want guaranteed specific macaron colors (caramel, chocolate, pink), pre-order to ensure availability.

4. **🍓 Confirm berry availability** — Imported berries (especially raspberries, cherries) can be inconsistent in Malaysian supermarkets. AEON Tebrau is your best bet. Jaya Grocer or Village Grocer (Mid Valley Southkey) are premium alternatives but open later.

5. **☕ Clear cup note** — Tell the coffee shop you specifically need a CLEAR cup (not opaque/colored). Most bubble tea / takeaway coffee shops in JB use clear cups, but specify to be safe.

6. **🥛 Milk** — A small carton of Meiji, Farm Fresh, or similar will look photogenic. Available at any convenience store (7-Eleven opens 24/7) or supermarket.
