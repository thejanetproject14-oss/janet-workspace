## Campaign Strategy Notes

### Recommended Approach
1. **Hero tier (3-5 creators):** Sahur Saleim, Sylvia/syloft, Francesca Tanmizi, Rayyan Afiq, Crystabel Tan — these should receive full PR packages with personalized notes connecting their existing content to the Sweet Treat concept.

2. **Food + Beauty crossover content:** Evelynne Xie, Boonki, fthwng, and Xuan should receive creative briefs that specifically lean into the dessert concept — matching lip shades to actual desserts, café GRWM content, "which dessert are you?" personality quizzes.

3. **Indie beauty community seeding:** Nabilah Khan, Sharmila Loganathan, Cinddie, and Rachell Ng — these creators already champion indie/artisanal brands and can position Analemma as a discovery.

4. **Nano-influencer wave:** Clara, Sasha Sanudin, Mehr Lakhiani, Kylie — cost-effective seeding that creates organic buzz at the grassroots level. High engagement rates, authentic content.

5. **Inclusivity angle:** Rayyan Afiq (male beauty) + Francesca Tanmizi (monolid-specific) + Sahur Saleim (skin positivity) — ensures the campaign represents diverse beauty perspectives.

### Content Ideas
- **"Match Your Lip to Your Dessert"** — café-hopping content where creators wear a shade that matches their order
- **"Blind Taste Test"** — creators guess which dessert inspired each shade (not actual tasting — reacting to the names/colours)
- **"Sweet Treat GRWM"** — getting ready content themed around dessert dates
- **"Vegan Beauty, Sweet Indulgence"** — positioning the product at the intersection of conscious beauty and playful self-expression
- **"5 Shades, 5 Moods"** — each shade styled differently for different occasions

### Budget Consideration
- Nano influencers (1-10K): Often accept gifted product only, or $100-300 per post
- Micro influencers (10-50K): Typically $300-1,500 per post in Singapore
- A mix of 8-10 gifted + 5-8 paid partnerships would create strong organic momentum
