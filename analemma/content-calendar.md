3. **Process / BTS** (20%) -- sourcing, packaging decisions, design sketches, photoshoot prep
4. **Founder** (15%) -- Janani's story, values, day-in-life as founder, "building in public"
5. **Aesthetic / Mood** (10%) -- flat lays, cinematic stills, color stories, inspiration boards

## Pre-Launch Phase Content (Jul 11 -- Launch)

### Week 1-2: Teaser + World-Building
- Story: "Something is coming" -- texture close-ups, color palettes, no product reveal yet
- Story: Behind-the-scenes of brand building (your desk, mood boards, fabric swatches)
- Carousel: The meaning of "Analemma" -- what the brand stands for
- Reel: Aesthetic montage (products partially visible, cinematic, music-driven)

### Week 3-4: Product Tease + Community Building
- Story: Polls ("Which color speaks to you?", "Silk or satin?")
- Carousel: "Why ritual luxury?" -- brand philosophy, intentional maximalism
- Reel: Unboxing one product (hands, textures, ASMR-style)
- Story: Day-in-life founder content (morning routine, design work, etc.)

### Week 5-6: Build Anticipation
- Carousel: Product reveal #1 -- hero SKU (lip product)
- Reel: Styling/lifestyle video with product
- Story: "Getting ready for our photoshoot" -- prep content
- Story: Countdown to launch (if date is set)

### Week 7-8: Launch Ready
- Carousel: Full product range reveal
- Reel: Photoshoot behind-the-scenes
- Story: "The website is almost ready" / "Link in bio soon"
- Launch day: IG post + Reel + Stories blitz + email announcement

## Post-Launch Recurring Ideas
- "Ingredient Spotlight" carousel series
- "How I Use..." Reel (product in daily routine)
- Customer testimonials / UGC reposts
- "Why I Chose..." series (design decisions, packaging choices)
- Flat lay photography series (seasonal, color-themed)
- Brunch event content (2 weeks of content from one event)
- "Made vs. Mass" -- quality/craft storytelling

## Rules
- No AI-generated video content. Everything real.
- Shoot on: Sony A7C (editorial), DJI Pocket 3 (BTS/vlog), Fujifilm XM5 (lifestyle)
- Edit in: Final Cut Pro (video), Procreate (graphics), Figma (carousels)
- Aesthetic: warm tones, natural light, ritualistic feel, intentional maximalism
- Caption voice: confident, poetic but not pretentious, personal, never salesy
- Hashtag strategy: 15-20 per post, mix of niche (#ritualluxury #sgbeauty) and broader (#skincare #handmade)

## Growth Tactics (Organic Only)
- Engage 15-20 accounts daily (genuine comments, not spam)
- Respond to every DM and comment within 12 hours
- Collaborate with micro-influencers (product-for-post, no paid)
- Use Stories polls/questions to boost engagement rate
- Reels: hook in first 1.5 seconds, trending audio when authentic
- Cross-post Reels to TikTok
- Share to relevant Facebook groups if appropriate
