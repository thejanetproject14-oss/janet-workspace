# 🍫 Analemma — "Sweet Treat" Lip Ganache Pre-Launch Content Calendar

**Launch Date:** March 8, 2026 (Sunday)
**Pre-Launch Window:** February 17 – March 8, 2026 (3 weeks)
**Platforms:** Instagram (primary, ~950 followers) · TikTok (secondary, early stage)
**Brand:** Analemma — vegan, luxury, intentional beauty
**Product:** "Sweet Treat" lip ganache in 5 dessert-inspired flavors that smell exactly like what they're called

### The 5 Flavors

| Flavor | Color Vibe | Dessert Pairing Aesthetic |
|---|---|---|
| 🍓 Raspberry Coulis | Deep berry-rose | Drizzled coulis on white plates |
| 🍓 Strawberry Jam | Warm strawberry pink | Toast & jam, summer picnics |
| ☕ Hot Cocoa | Rich warm brown | Mugs, marshmallows, cozy |
| 🍒 Maraschino Cherry | Bold retro red | Cherries on sundaes, vintage glam |
| ☕ Tiramisu | Muted nude-brown | Coffee, cocoa dust, Italian patisserie |

---

## 📋 Strategy Overview

### Content Pillars

1. **Behind-the-Scenes (BTS)** — Lab days, formulation, packaging, the messy real stuff
2. **Product Teasers** — Flavor reveals, texture shots, swatch content
3. **Founder Story** — Why Analemma exists, the vegan/intentional beauty mission
4. **Dessert Aesthetic** — Moodboards, flat lays, dessert-inspired visuals
5. **Community Building** — Polls, questions, giveaways, early access

### Capacity (Solo Founder — Realistic)

| Format | Frequency | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| High-quality video (Reel/TikTok) | 1x/week | Shot + edited in batches; NO AI-generated video |
| Carousel post | 1x/week | Can design in Canva; batch 2-3 at a time |
| Stories | Daily (3-5 frames) | Low-effort: phone camera, polls, reposts, text slides |
| Static photo post | As needed | From same shoot as carousel/video |

### Posting Schedule (Optimized for Singapore Audience)

| Day | Format | Best Time (SGT / UTC+8) |
|---|---|---|
| **Tuesday** | Carousel or Static Post | 12:00 PM SGT (lunch scroll) |
| **Thursday** | Reel / TikTok Video | 7:30 PM SGT (evening prime) |
| **Saturday** | Bonus post (static/story-only) | 10:00 AM SGT (weekend browse) |
| **Daily** | Stories | 11 AM–1 PM + 7–9 PM SGT |

> **Why these times:** SG's peak Instagram usage is lunch hour (12–1 PM) and evening (7–9 PM). Weekends see morning engagement spikes. For a ~950-follower account, consistency matters more than perfection.

### Cross-Posting Strategy

- **Instagram** = polished, curated, evergreen. Primary platform.
- **TikTok** = raw, personality-forward, trend-aware. Repurpose Reels but add native captions/sounds. Post same day or next day.
- Don't stress TikTok — it's a seeding ground. Even 1-2 posts/week is fine.

3 days.

I'm not going to pretend I'm not nervous.
this is the first product I've ever launched under analemma,
and it means more to me than I can put into a caption.

sweet treat is months of formulating, testing, scrapping,
starting over, and refusing to settle.

it's vegan because that's non-negotiable.
it's luxury because you deserve that.
it smells like dessert because... why wouldn't it? 🍫

march 8. I made this for you.

## 📱 Story Strategy (Daily Framework)

Since stories are your daily touchpoint, here's a repeatable framework so you're not reinventing the wheel every day:

### Weekday Story Formula (3-5 frames)
1. **Hook** — Something visual or text that makes people tap (question, behind-the-scenes peek, countdown)
2. **Content** — The actual thing (product shot, BTS clip, flavor fact, founder thought)
3. **Engagement** — Poll, quiz, question box, emoji slider, or "DM me"

### Story Content Bank (Pick & Rotate)

| Category | Ideas |
|---|---|
| **BTS** | Lab footage, ingredient close-ups, packaging assembly, label printing, desk setup |
| **Product** | Swatch of the day, texture close-ups, "guess the flavor," side-by-side with real dessert |
| **Founder** | Voice notes about the journey, "things nobody tells you about launching a brand," daily mood |
| **Dessert Aesthetic** | Dessert-of-the-day inspo, café photos, "this is giving [flavor name]," moodboards |
| **Community** | Repost follower DMs/comments, "what flavor should I swatch next?", "tell me your fave dessert" |
| **Countdown** | Daily countdown graphic (batch-design in Canva), milestone reminders |

### Instagram Stories Highlights (Set up before launch)
Create these highlight covers in brand colors:

- 🍫 **Sweet Treat** — All product-related stories
- 🎬 **BTS** — Behind-the-scenes content
- 💌 **About** — Founder story, brand mission
- 📍 **Launch** — Countdown stories, launch day recap

---

## ⏰ Countdown Strategy

### The 21-Day Arc

| Phase | Days | Energy | Focus |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Week 1 (Feb 17-23)** | 21–15 days out | Mysterious, intriguing | "Something sweet is coming" — no product shown |
| **Week 2 (Feb 24-Mar 1)** | 14–7 days out | Exciting, revealing | Product name + flavor reveals + swatches |
| **Week 3 (Mar 2-8)** | 7–0 days out | Urgent, emotional | "It's almost here" — details, founder story, final push |

### Daily Countdown Stories (Start Mar 1)
- From **7 days out**, post a countdown story every single day
- Use a consistent template (Canva) — same font, same style, just change the number
- Add the Instagram countdown sticker (set to Mar 8, exact launch time) on every countdown story so people can subscribe to the reminder

### Key Hype Moments
- **Day 14 (Feb 22):** "2 weeks to go" post/story
- **Day 7 (Mar 1):** "1 week to go" — energy shift, things get real
- **Day 3 (Mar 5):** Founder letter Reel — emotional anchor
- **Day 1 (Mar 7):** "Tomorrow." — dramatic, clean
- **Day 0 (Mar 8):** LAUNCH 🚀

## 📈 Success Metrics (What to Track)

Don't obsess over follower count. For a ~950 account pre-launch, focus on:

| Metric | Target | Why It Matters |
|---|---|---|
| **Story views** | 100-200 per story | Shows active audience size |
| **Carousel saves** | 20-50 per post | Saves = "I want this" intent |
| **Reel reach** | 2-5x follower count | Reels drive discovery |
| **DMs received** | 10+ per week | Purchase intent + community |
| **Link clicks (bio)** | Track via Linktree/Beacons | Direct launch interest |
| **Countdown sticker subscriptions** | 50+ | People who'll get launch notification |
| **Comments** | 10-20 per post | Engagement for algorithm |

---

## 🧠 Content Do's and Don'ts

### DO ✅
- Show the real, messy process — perfection is boring, relatability builds trust
- Respond to every comment and DM during pre-launch (you're small, this is your superpower)
- Use the "save this post" CTA — saves are the #1 algorithm signal on Instagram in 2026
- Share your genuine reactions — first time holding the final product, first order, etc.
- Repurpose everything — a Reel becomes stories becomes a TikTok becomes a still for a post
- Use close-up, textural shots — ganache texture is inherently satisfying content

### DON'T ❌
- Don't use AI-generated video — it clashes with the "intentional" brand pillar
- Don't post and ghost — engage for 15-30 min after every post (comment back, like replies)
- Don't reveal everything in Week 1 — the tease-reveal-launch arc needs tension
- Don't apologize for selling — you made something incredible, promote it proudly
- Don't compare yourself to big brands — your story is your edge
- Don't buy followers before launch — fake engagement will tank your reach when it matters most

## 💡 Bonus Ideas (If You Have Extra Energy)

1. **Early Access List:** Create a simple Google Form or email sign-up. Promote in stories: "Want to shop 1 hour before everyone else? Join the early access list." This builds your email list AND creates urgency.

2. **Flavor of the Day (Launch Week):** Mon-Fri of launch week, spotlight one flavor per day in stories. Monday = Raspberry Coulis, Tuesday = Strawberry Jam, etc. Builds anticipation and gives each shade its moment.

3. **Dessert Pairing Reels (Post-Launch):** After launch, create Reels pairing each shade with its actual dessert — wearing Tiramisu while making tiramisu, etc. Great evergreen content.

4. **Micro-Influencer Seeding:** Send PR packages to 3-5 Singapore-based micro-influencers (1K-10K followers) in the vegan/beauty/food space. Even 1-2 posts from them can meaningfully move the needle at your size. Time it so their posts go live launch week.

5. **"Why Lip Ganache?":** An educational Reel explaining the texture/format. Most people don't know what lip ganache is — that's a content opportunity, not a problem.

*Calendar created Feb 15, 2026. Adjust based on real-time engagement data — if something pops off, make more of it. If something flops, pivot fast. You're small and nimble — that's your advantage.* 🍫
