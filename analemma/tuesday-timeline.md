## 🚨 RISKS + CONTINGENCIES

| Risk | Plan B |
|------|--------|
| **Border jam (>1 hr delay)** | Skip Seven Oaks. Go straight to AEON → coffee → studio. You have buffer until 11:30. |
| **Sienna pre-order fails** | Buy any pink-iced cupcake/muffin from Lavender Bakery or AEON bakery section. Pipe extra pink frosting yourself if desperate (bring a small tube of pink icing from SG). |
| **Raspberries/cherries unavailable** | Use extra strawberries + jarred maraschino cherries (already on SG list). Blueberries as color sub. |
| **Lavender Bakery out of macarons** | Drive to **Maco Cafe** (65 Jln Sutera Tanjung 8/2, Taman Sutera Utama, ~20 min) — best macarons in JB. Or check AEON bakery section. |
| **No tiramisu slices anywhere** | Use lady fingers + cocoa powder dusting to *build* a mini tiramisu look on a plate. Secret Recipe (Taman Molek area, opens ~10 AM) always has tiramisu cake slices. |
| **Coffee goes cold / looks flat** | Tropical Coffee Cafe is 2 min from studio — send someone for a fresh one mid-shoot. |
| **Forgot something in SG** | AEON Tebrau City has most basics. For specialty items, check Daiso in AEON (styling props, small plates). |
| **Rain / traffic delay coming home** | Not urgent — shoot is done. Relax, grab dinner in JB, cross when traffic clears. |
| **Camera/memory card issue** | Portable charger as backup power. Phone camera as emergency backup. Shoot to TWO cards if possible. |
