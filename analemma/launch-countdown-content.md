### Day 34 -- Friday, Mar 7

**Theme:** 1 Day -- Tomorrow Changes Everything

**Feed Post:**
- **Concept:** The "eve of launch" post. Dark, dramatic product shot. Moody lighting. One single tube or all five in shadow. Cinematic energy.
- **Image needed:** Moodiest photoshoot shot. Or take a new one -- single tube on dark surface, single spotlight or candle light, phone camera.
- **Caption:**
  > tomorrow.
  >
  > there are products you make and there are products you pour your whole self into. the sweet treat collection is the second kind.
  >
  > every scent was tested dozens of times. every shade was chosen because it made me feel something. every detail -- from the formula to the packaging -- was agonized over, doubted, and then loved.
  >
  > tomorrow morning, it's finally yours.
  >
  > lip ganache. sweet treat collection. march 8. link in bio at launch.
  >
  > i'll see you there. 🖤
  >
  > #Analemma #LipGanache #SweetTreatCollection #LaunchDay #Tomorrow #VeganBeauty #VeganLipstick #CrueltyFreeBeauty #IndieBeauty #SmallBusinessLaunch

**Stories (3):**
1. **"1 DAY" graphic** -- maximum drama. Black background, gold or white text, maybe a slow zoom animation
2. **"This time tomorrow" text on a black screen** -- let the anticipation build
3. **Final countdown sticker story:** "TOMORROW 🚀" with countdown sticker hitting zero at midnight / launch time

**Reel:**
- **Concept:** 15-second "teaser trailer" for the collection. Quick cuts of the best photoshoot images and video clips. Text overlays with each flavor name flashing. End on "March 8. Link in bio."
- **Shot list (all from existing footage/photos):**
  1. Quick flash: photoshoot setup (1 sec)
  2. Raspberry Coulis hero shot (1.5 sec)
  3. Swatch being applied (1.5 sec)
  4. Strawberry Jam (1 sec)
  5. Hot Cocoa (1 sec)
  6. Close-up texture shot (1 sec)
  7. Maraschino Cherry (1 sec)
  8. Tiramisu (1 sec)
  9. All 5 together (2 sec)
  10. "Tomorrow." text on black (2 sec)
  11. Analemma logo + "March 8" (2 sec)
- **Audio vibe:** Building, cinematic. A beat drop or crescendo moment. Search trending "reveal" or "glow up" audios.
- **Edit in:** CapCut or InShot. Use flash transitions. This should feel fast and exciting.

**Effort Level:** 🟡 Medium (45 min) -- post + reel edit (use existing assets, it's assembly not new footage)

**Assets Needed:**
- Moody/dark product photo (from photoshoot or new phone shot)
- Compiled clips/photos for reel (all from existing shoot)
- "1 DAY" graphic

## LAUNCH DAY

### Day 35 -- Saturday, Mar 8 🚀

**Theme:** IT'S HERE. LAUNCH DAY. FULL BLITZ.

**Timeline for the day:**

**Morning (8-9 AM -- before launch goes live):**

**Stories (pre-launch):**
1. **"Today" text on black** -- no other words needed
2. **Quick talking-head video (film while getting ready):** "It's March 8. It's launch day. The website goes live at [TIME]. I'm shaking. Okay, let's do this."
3. **"Going live at [TIME]" graphic** with countdown sticker to exact launch minute

---

**LAUNCH MOMENT (e.g., 10 AM or whenever site goes live):**

**Feed Post #1 (THE launch post):**
- **Concept:** The absolute best carousel from the photoshoot. This is the most polished, most beautiful, most save-worthy post.
  - Slide 1: All 5 shades, hero group shot, editorial
  - Slide 2: Lip swatches (all 5 on model, labeled)
  - Slide 3: Individual hero shot montage (2x3 grid or strip)
  - Slide 4: Brand story text card -- "Vegan. Cruelty-free. Dessert-scented. Made with love."
  - Slide 5: "Shop now -- link in bio" with website preview
- **Caption:**
  > she's here. 🍓🍫🍒☕
  >
  > the sweet treat collection by analemma is officially live.
  >
  > five dessert-scented lip ganaches -- each one vegan, cruelty-free, and made to feel like the most indulgent thing your lips have ever touched.
  >
  > 🍓 raspberry coulis -- deep, tart, bold
  > 🍓 strawberry jam -- warm, classic, nostalgic
  > 🍫 hot cocoa -- rich, cozy, velvety
  > 🍒 maraschino cherry -- unapologetic, striking, unforgettable
  > ☕ tiramisu -- layered, sophisticated, mysterious
  >
  > this collection took months of testing, reformulating, and refusing to settle. every detail is intentional. every ingredient is clean. every scent is real.
  >
  > shop the sweet treat collection now -- link in bio.
  >
  > thank you for being here. this is just the beginning. 🖤

---

**Afternoon (1-3 PM):**

**Feed Post #2 (optional -- only if engagement is strong):**
- **Concept:** A more personal, candid photo. Her holding the product. Genuine smile. The "I did it" moment. Or a photo of the first order notification on her phone.
- **Caption:**
  > first orders are coming in and i'm not crying, you're crying.
  >
  > okay, i'm crying.
  >
  > thank you. genuinely. every single order means the world. this started as a dream and today it's real.
  >
  > if you haven't shopped yet -- the link is in my bio. the sweet treat collection is waiting for you. 🍓🍫🍒☕
  >

3. **Reminder link sticker:** "still haven't grabbed yours? 👀"

---

**Evening (6-8 PM):**

**Reel:**
- **Concept:** Launch day recap montage. "How launch day actually went." A mix of emotions -- morning anxiety, the moment the site went live, checking orders, celebrating.
- **Shot list (film throughout the day):**
  1. Morning -- alarm going off, nervous face
  2. Final website check on laptop
  3. Pressing "publish" or making the site live (screen recording)
  4. Refreshing order page -- reaction to first order
  5. Packing first order
  6. Talking to camera: "we did it"
  7. End: product beauty shot + "shop now, link in bio"
- **Audio vibe:** Feel-good, celebratory. Trending audio with a buildup. Think "started from the bottom" energy.
- **Note:** Film clips throughout the day on phone or DJI Pocket 3. Edit in evening. Post by 8 PM.

**Stories (evening):**
1. **Thank you talking-head story:** Genuine, emotional, grateful. "Day one is done. This is just the beginning. Thank you for believing in this."
2. **Final link sticker** of the day

**Effort Level:** 🔴 High (full day is launch day -- all-in, but it's a Saturday)

**Assets Needed:**
- Best carousel from photoshoot (prep night before)
- Graphics: "WE'RE LIVE" celebration graphic, individual shade link cards
- DJI Pocket 3 charged and accessible all day for filming
- Phone for stories all day
- Screen recording of website ready

## Post-Launch Notes

**Sunday, Mar 9:** Post a "thank you" story + repost any customer content. Rest. You did it.

**Week of Mar 9-15:** Shift to customer content, reviews, styled reposts, "how I wear it" content. One feed post every 2-3 days. Stories daily. The hard sprint is over.
