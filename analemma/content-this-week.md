# Content Plan -- This Week (Jul 11-18) ✦

You're in pre-launch. No one knows what's coming yet. That's your advantage -- build curiosity before you reveal anything.

---

## Story Ideas (2-3/day, mix and match)

### Behind-the-Scenes That Actually Works:
People don't care about "I'm building a brand." They care about **specifics** that make them curious.

1. **The photoshoot recap** -- "just wrapped a shoot in JB" + one teaser photo (no full product reveal yet). The dessert theme is gold content.
2. **Close-up textures** -- film your finger swiping a lip ganache. Don't show the label. Just color + texture + the *sound* of the product. ASMR energy.
3. **The naming story** -- "Why would a beauty brand name products after desserts?" Quick story slide or talking-to-camera. Raspberry Coulis, Hot Cocoa, Tiramisu -- these names are content.
4. **Color swatches on skin** -- film the 5 lip ganache shades on your arm or hand. No branding. Just pure color. Ask: "Which one are you?"
5. **Product flat lay in progress** -- show products being arranged for a photo, not the final photo. The "making of" is more engaging than the result.
6. **Scent storytelling** -- "This one smells exactly like ___." Hold a product, close your eyes, describe it. People can't smell through a screen but they'll want to.
7. **Packaging close-ups** -- hands opening a box, peeling tissue paper, revealing a product. Slow. Cinematic. Satisfying.
8. **Your workspace** -- moodboard on the wall, product samples on the desk, fabric swatches, Procreate sketches. "Where it all happens."
9. **The vegan angle** -- "Everything in this line is vegan. Here's why that mattered to me." Quick story, genuine.
10. **Polling** -- show two bag charm shapes: "Apple or Cherry?" People love voting. It creates investment.

### What NOT to Post:
- Generic motivational quotes
- "Exciting things coming!" with no visual (empty hype)
- AI-generated anything
- Overly polished corporate content (you're a founder, be human)

## Feed Posts This Week

### Post 1 (Carousel -- mid-week)
**Concept:** "What if luxury smelled like your favorite dessert?"
- Slide 1: Bold text on brand-color background
- Slide 2-3: Close-up textures / swatches (from photoshoot selects)
- Slide 4: The 5 flavor names listed beautifully
- Slide 5: "Coming soon. Stay close." + handle

### Post 2 (Reel -- end of week, optional if you have bandwidth)
**Concept:** Photoshoot BTS montage
- Quick cuts: getting ready, product placement, the dessert styling, final poses
- Cinematic. Warm tones. Trending audio (not gimmicky).
- Caption: Keep it short. "The Sweet Treat collection. Shot on film and sugar."
- Use DJI Pocket 3 footage if you captured BTS at the shoot

## This Week's Minimum Viable Content
If you do nothing else:
1. **3 stories showing photoshoot teaser content** (textures, colors, setup)
2. **1 poll story** ("Which flavor?")
3. **1 carousel** (the dessert concept reveal)

That's it. 30-45 minutes of work. But it starts the drumbeat.
