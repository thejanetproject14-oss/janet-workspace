# Analemma Launch Plan ✦

## Timeline
- **Dec 2025:** First launch at Night at Orchard. Bag charms sold well. Other products less traction.
- **Mar 8, 2026:** Lip Ganache launch. THIS IS THE DATE. 22 days from today.

## Current Status (Feb 14, 2026)
- **Website:** NOT READY. Shopify. Domain secured. No pages, no checkout. **#1 PRIORITY.**
- **Lip ganache:** Product ready. 5 flavors. Photoshoot done (dessert theme, JB). Photos need review.
- **Other products:** Available from Dec launch (bag charms, handbags, pouches, hair oil, etc.)
- **Content:** ~950 IG followers. Need to ramp NOW.
- **Brunch:** Not planned yet. May need to push to post-launch.

## The Math
- 22 days to launch.
- Website must be live and shoppable BEFORE Mar 8.
- Photoshoot photos must be selected and edited.
- Product pages need copy, photos, pricing.
- Checkout flow must work end to end.
