## ⚠️ NOTES
- **A4 paper forgotten** -- use white chart paper or ask Dellea if they have any
- **Pour vessel needed** for drizzle shots (D1, D3 chocolate pour)
- **Medical gloves** for clean handling during messy shots
- **Clean tubes between shots** -- wet wipes between every dessert setup
- **Shoot dessert-only (Section C) EARLY** before food starts looking tired
- **Chocolate/caramel drizzle shots are messy** -- keep backup tubes protected, do these LAST within each block
