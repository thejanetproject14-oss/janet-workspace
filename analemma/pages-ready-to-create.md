<h2>The Story</h2>
<h3>We Didn't Start a Beauty Brand. We Started a Ritual.</h3>

<p>Analemma began with a question: what if your beauty routine wasn't something to rush through?</p>

<p>What if the lipstick you reached for every morning smelled like dessert and made you pause for a second — just one second — to appreciate the small, intentional act of putting yourself together?</p>

<p>What if your accessories told a story? What if your perfume felt like a memory? What if "getting ready" was the part of the day you actually looked forward to?</p>

<p>That's what we're building.</p>

<h2>The Name</h2>

<p>An analemma is the figure-eight pattern the sun traces across the sky over the course of a year. It's a symbol of cycles, of return, of the beautiful predictability of showing up — day after day — and still finding something new in the light.</p>

<p>We chose it because beauty, to us, isn't about transformation. It's about ritual. It's about the daily return to yourself.</p>

<h2>The Beginning</h2>

<p>Our first night out was Night at Orchard in December 2025 — a table full of beaded bag charms and a belief that people would care about beauty made with intention. They did. The charms sold. The conversations were better.</p>

<p>We met women who wanted more from their beauty products — not more ingredients, not more steps, but more meaning. More delight. More of the feeling that someone made this <em>for them</em>.</p>

<p>So we made more.</p>

<h2>What We Believe</h2>

<p><strong>Beauty is ritual.</strong> Not a chore. Not vanity. A daily act of choosing yourself.</p>

<p><strong>Vegan is the baseline.</strong> Every product, every material, every formula. No exceptions. No asterisks.</p>

<p><strong>Luxury should feel warm.</strong> Not cold. Not exclusive. Like your best friend who happens to have extraordinary taste.</p>

<p><strong>Intentional over trendy.</strong> We don't chase what's popular. We make what's meaningful. Our product names, our scents, our patterns — everything is chosen with care.</p>

<p><strong>Details are the point.</strong> A lip ganache that smells like the dessert it's named after. A bag charm that makes strangers smile at you. A perfume named for a goddess. The details are where the love lives.</p>

<h2>Ankaa by Analemma</h2>

<p>Ankaa is the brightest star in the Phoenix constellation — a symbol of rebirth and radiance. It's the name we give to our accessories and lifestyle pieces: the bag charms, the pouches, the pins, the handbags. Objects designed to carry your world with beauty and intention.</p>

<p style="text-align: center; font-size: 1.2em;"><em>We make beauty for women who pay attention. Welcome to Analemma.</em></p>

## Page 2: Frequently Asked Questions

**Title:** Frequently Asked Questions
**Handle:** faq

```html
<h3>Are all Analemma products vegan?</h3>
<p>Yes. Every single product — from our lip ganache formulas to our handbag materials to our brush bristles — is 100% vegan and cruelty-free. No exceptions.</p>

<h3>Where do you ship to?</h3>
<p>We currently ship within Singapore. International shipping is on our roadmap — follow us on Instagram @analemma for updates on when we expand.</p>

<h3>How long does shipping take?</h3>
<p>Standard shipping within Singapore takes 3-5 business days. You'll receive a tracking number via email once your order ships.</p>

<h3>How much does shipping cost?</h3>
<p>Standard shipping within Singapore is $4.50. Orders over $80 qualify for free shipping.</p>

<h3>What is your return policy?</h3>
<p>We accept returns on unused, unopened products within 14 days of delivery. Items must be in their original packaging. Due to hygiene, we cannot accept returns on opened beauty products (lip ganache, hair oil, perfumes). Accessories and handbags may be returned if unused and in original condition. Please see our Shipping &amp; Returns page for full details.</p>

<h3>Can I exchange a product?</h3>
<p>We don't offer direct exchanges at this time. If you'd like a different product, please return your original item (if eligible) and place a new order. We'll process your return as quickly as possible.</p>

<h3>Are your fragrances tested on animals?</h3>
<p>Never. All Analemma products are cruelty-free. Our fragrances are formulated without any animal-derived ingredients and are never tested on animals at any stage of development.</p>

<h3>What are the Lip Ganache scents made from?</h3>
<p>Our Sweet Treat lip ganache scents are created using food-grade fragrance oils that are safe for lip application. Each flavor is scented to match its dessert namesake — so Raspberry Coulis smells like raspberry, Hot Cocoa smells like cocoa, and so on. All scent ingredients are vegan.</p>

<h3>Do you offer gift wrapping?</h3>
<p>We're working on a gifting option for future launches. In the meantime, all Analemma products come in beautiful branded packaging that's gift-ready as-is.</p>

<h3>What's the difference between the 15ml and 100ml perfumes?</h3>
<p>Same fragrance, different size. The 15ml is perfect for travel, your handbag, or trying a new scent. The 100ml is your full vanity bottle for daily wear. Both are eau de parfum concentration.</p>

<h3>How should I store my perfume?</h3>
<p>Keep your perfume in a cool, dry place away from direct sunlight. Avoid storing it in the bathroom, where heat and humidity can alter the fragrance over time. A bedroom drawer or vanity shelf is ideal.</p>

<h3>Are the beaded handbags fragile?</h3>
<p>Our beaded handbags are handcrafted to be both beautiful and durable. That said, they're best treated as evening/occasion bags rather than everyday carry. Avoid overstuffing, and store flat or stuffed with tissue to maintain shape.</p>

<h3>What is the Lip Balm Charm bundle deal?</h3>
<p>When you purchase any Lip Ganache from the Sweet Treat collection, you can add a Lip Balm Charm (Silver or Gold) for $18 instead of the regular price of $22. The discount applies automatically at checkout.</p>

<h3>Can I cancel or modify my order after placing it?</h3>
<p>If your order hasn't shipped yet, email us at hello@analemma.sg as soon as possible and we'll do our best to accommodate changes. Once shipped, we're unable to modify orders, but you may be eligible for a return.</p>

<h3>How can I contact you?</h3>
<p>Email us at hello@analemma.sg or reach out on Instagram @analemma. We typically respond within 24 hours during business days.</p>
