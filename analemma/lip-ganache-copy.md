# Sweet Treat Lip Ganache Collection

## Raspberry Coulis

**Tagline:** Tart on the tongue. Sweet on the lips.

**Product Description:**
A berry-toned lip ganache that blurs the line between fruit and flower. Sheer, buildable color with a glossy, balm-like finish that smells exactly like fresh raspberries simmered down to their most gorgeous concentrate.

**Sensory Copy:**
Imagine dragging a silver spoon through a warm pool of raspberry coulis, the kind plated beneath a perfect panna cotta at the kind of restaurant that doesn't list prices. That tartness, that brightness, that almost-floral bite of ripe berry at the very peak of its season. This is what your lips smell like now. The color lands somewhere between crushed berry and rosé stain, sheer enough to layer, pigmented enough to notice. The texture is rich without weight, glossy without stick. It feels like velvet that melted. You will reapply not because it faded, but because the ritual of it is too good to do just once.

## Strawberry Jam

**Tagline:** Your sweetest habit.

**Product Description:**
Pink, plush, and unapologetically sweet. Strawberry Jam is the lip ganache equivalent of a warm scone situation: classic, comforting, and impossibly pretty. The scent is sun-ripe strawberry preserves, the kind made slowly, by hand, with too much fruit and not enough sugar.

**Sensory Copy:**
There is a particular pink that only exists in two places: the inside of a strawberry, sliced clean through on a summer morning, and on a mouth wearing this. Strawberry Jam is the shade your lips already want to be, just more. More saturated, more cushioned, more alive. The formula is dense with moisture, a pillowy coat that makes your mouth feel like something from a still life painting. And the fragrance is not perfume, not candy. It's real strawberry sweetness, the kind that stains your fingertips and lingers on warm toast. Put it on. Press your lips together. You'll smile before the mirror even reflects it back.

## Hot Cocoa

**Tagline:** Warm from the first swipe.

**Product Description:**
A caramel-kissed lip ganache that wraps your mouth in the warmth of the first sip. Not dark, not bitter. This is the golden, milky, brown-sugar side of cocoa, the one that feels like a cashmere blanket in color form. Smells like a mug you don't want to put down.

**Sensory Copy:**
Close your eyes. You're holding a ceramic mug, heavy and handmade, filled with something slow-stirred and steaming. Not the sharp, dark kind of chocolate. The other one. The one with caramel swirled through warm milk, a dusting of raw cacao, a whisper of vanilla that only shows up at the very end. That is what Hot Cocoa smells like against your skin. The shade is a tawny, honeyed neutral with just enough warmth to glow, the color of candlelight on bare skin. On the lips, it feels like a second skin that happens to be softer than your first. This is the shade for slow mornings, long evenings, and every quiet moment you're building a beautiful life inside of.

## Maraschino Cherry

**Tagline:** A little dangerous. Entirely worth it.

**Product Description:**
Deep red with a pulse. Maraschino Cherry is the boldest shade in the collection, a saturated, moody red that reads like confidence with a sweet tooth. The scent is that bright, syrupy, unmistakable cherry, the one you always steal from the top of the glass.

**Sensory Copy:**
This is the color that makes people pause mid-sentence. A red so deliberate it almost feels like a dare. Maraschino Cherry doesn't tiptoe into a room. It arrives. The pigment is deep and lush, somewhere between a vintage Hollywood pout and a cherry dropped into something sparkling. There's warmth in it, but there's an edge too, a richness that borders on dramatic and lands right at stunning. The formula clings to every curve of the lip without settling or feathering, just pure, unapologetic color. And the scent is the thing that makes it personal: sweet, syrupy, unmistakably cherry, like biting into the garnish before anyone's watching. Bold shade. Soft mouth. The contrast is the whole point.

## Tiramisu

**Tagline:** Sophisticated on contact.

**Product Description:**
A coffee-toned lip ganache for the person who takes their beauty as seriously as their espresso order. Layered, warm, and quietly complex. Tiramisu smells like mascarpone and fresh espresso and the last perfect bite of something you ordered because you have taste.

**Sensory Copy:**
Some shades are simple. This one has layers. Tiramisu opens with a cool espresso undertone, a grounded, slightly smoky brown that reads as effortlessly polished. But underneath, there's warmth: a cocoa-dusted softness, a creaminess that keeps it from ever feeling severe. It's the beauty equivalent of something that looks easy but isn't. On the lips, the texture is impossibly smooth, the kind of formula that makes you run your tongue across your bottom lip just to confirm it's real. The scent blooms slowly. First the coffee note, roasted and rich. Then the sweetness underneath, soft mascarpone, a dusting of cacao, something that lingers the way a good dessert haunts you on the drive home. This is not your casual, grab-and-go shade. This is the one you reach for when you want to feel like the most interesting person at the table.
