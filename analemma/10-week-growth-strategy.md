# Analemma "Sweet Treat" -- 10-Week Growth Strategy
## 80 → 1,000 Followers | Feb 17 -- April 27, 2026

**Brand:** Analemma | **Product:** Sweet Treat Lip Ganache (5 flavors)
**Launch Date:** March 8, 2026
**Current Followers:** 80 | **Target:** 1,000 by Week 8 (April 13)
**Platforms:** Instagram (primary), TikTok (secondary)
**Founder:** Janani (solo) | **Based in:** Singapore

---

## The Big Picture

### Why 80 → 1,000 Is Achievable
- Instagram's algorithm actively pushes Reels from small accounts to the Explore page
- Food/dessert aesthetic content is inherently shareable and saveable
- Singapore's beauty community is tight-knit -- 25 PR boxes create a network effect
- TikTok cross-posting doubles your discovery surface with zero extra effort
- You have authentic founder journey footage that outperforms polished brand content

### Growth Model
| Phase | Weeks | Goal | Strategy |
|-------|-------|------|----------|
| **Tease** | 1-2 (Feb 17 -- Mar 2) | 80 → 150 | Dessert aesthetic + curiosity. No product shown. |
| **Reveal** | 3 (Mar 3 -- Mar 8) | 150 → 250 | Product reveal + founder story. Build to launch. |
| **Launch** | 4 (Mar 10 -- Mar 16) | 250 → 400 | Launch content + influencer wave. Biggest growth spike. |
| **Momentum** | 5-6 (Mar 17 -- Mar 30) | 400 → 600 | Influencer reposts + customer content + education. |
| **Sustain** | 7-8 (Mar 31 -- Apr 13) | 600 → 1,000 | Community building + collab + viral attempts. |
| **Scale** | 9-10 (Apr 14 -- Apr 27) | 1,000+ | Consolidate. Optimize what works. Plan next product. |

## Content Pillars (Revised)

Since there's no BTS lab footage, these are the five pillars:

### 1. 🍰 Dessert Aesthetic (40% of content)
- Food styling, flat lays, dessert mood boards
- "Would you eat this or wear it?" type posts
- Satisfying textures, drizzles, close-ups
- This is your discovery engine -- it appeals beyond beauty audiences

### 2. 👩‍💼 Founder Journey (25% of content)
- Payment video, sample unboxing, supplier messages
- "Say it again" cab testimonial (HERO CLIP)
- Working in different locations montage
- "I want one side to be empty" -- the customization origin story
- Real, raw, no script needed

### 3. 💄 Product Reveals (15% of content)
- Phased reveals: name → packaging → shades → swatches → full product
- Each flavor gets its own moment
- Swatch videos, texture shots, scent descriptions

### 4. 📚 Educational (10% of content)
- "What is a lip ganache?"
- "Why vegan beauty matters"
- Ingredient spotlights (ashwagandha future tease, saffron, nourishing ingredients)
- "5 things to look for in a lip product"

### 5. 👥 Community & UGC (10% of content -- ramps up post-launch)
- Influencer reposts
- Customer reactions
- Polls, questions, "choose your flavor"
- Bridgerton party content

---

## Hashtag Strategy (80-Follower Tier)

### Rules
- 15-20 hashtags per Instagram post
- Target hashtags with 10K-500K posts (your sweet spot for discovery)
- Avoid mega-hashtags (1M+) where you'll be buried
- 3-5 hashtags on TikTok max
- Rotate sets to avoid shadowban

### Hashtag Sets (Rotate These)

**Set A -- Vegan Beauty**
```
#veganbeautysg #veganmakeup #veganlipstick #crueltyfreemakeup #cleanbeautysg #indiebeauty #intentionalbeauty #veganbeautyproducts #plantbasedbeauty #crueltyfreelips
```

**Set B -- Dessert/Food Aesthetic**
```
#dessertaesthetic #foodandbeauty #dessertlips #sweettreat #patisserie #dessertinspo #foodstyling #flatlaystyle #aestheticfood #sweettooth
```

**Set C -- Singapore Beauty**
```
#sgbeauty #singaporebeauty #sgmakeup #beautybloggersg #makeupartistsg #beautycommunitysg #sgindiebeauty #beautylaunch #newproductlaunch #shoplocal
```

**Set D -- Founder/Small Business**
```
#indiebeautybrand #smallbusinesssg #womanfounded #beautyfounder #founderstory #buildingabrand #beautybusiness #sgentrepreneur #smallbatchbeauty #handmadebeauty
```

**Set E -- Lip Specific**
```
#lipganache #lipcolor #lipstickaddict #lipswatch #lipproduct #bestlipstick #lipcare #lipartist #boldlips #lipstickoftheday
```

**Per post:** Pick 3-4 from the relevant set + 3-4 from Set C (always) + 3-4 from one other set + 2-3 brand hashtags (#analemma #sweettreat #lipganache)

---

## Discovery Strategy

### Reels-First Approach
- Post 2-3 Reels/week minimum (these are your growth engine)
- First 3 seconds = hook (text overlay or visual surprise)
- 15-30 seconds optimal for discovery
- Use trending audio when it fits the aesthetic (check Reels tab daily)
- Always add captions/subtitles
- Cross-post every Reel to TikTok (same day or next day)

### TikTok Cross-Posting
- Repost every Instagram Reel to TikTok (without the IG watermark -- save before posting to IG, or use SnapTik)
- Add native TikTok captions and trending sounds
- TikTok favors raw/authentic > polished -- lean into that
- Post at 7-9pm SGT on TikTok (peak Singapore hours)
- Use TikTok-native language in captions ("no bc why does this lip product smell like ACTUAL tiramisu 😭")

### Engagement Tactics (15-20 min/day)
- **Before posting:** Spend 10 min engaging with accounts in your niche (comment genuinely on 10-15 posts)
- **After posting:** Spend 10 min replying to every comment within the first hour (algorithm boost)
- **Daily:** Follow 5-10 relevant accounts (beauty bloggers, vegan brands, SG food accounts)
- **Comment strategy:** Leave thoughtful comments (not "nice!") on accounts with 1K-50K followers -- their audiences will see you
- **Stories engagement:** React to other brands' stories, respond to polls, use "Add Yours" stickers

### Collaboration Opportunities
- **Dessert/café collab:** Partner with a SG café for a "Sweet Treat x [café]" content shoot -- you bring the lip products, they get exposure
- **Cross-features:** Ask nano-influencers (500-5K) for story takeovers or joint content
- **Beauty community:** Join SG beauty Telegram/WhatsApp groups, participate genuinely
- **Bridgerton party (Feb 28):** Every guest = potential content creator. Set up a photo station with products.

---

## PR & Influencer Strategy

### Pre-Send (Feb 19-28)
- DM influencers by Feb 25 (warm intro, no hard pitch)
- Message template: personal, reference their content, explain why you chose them
- Don't say "we'd love to send you products in exchange for a post"
- DO say "we made something we think you'd genuinely love -- can we send you a box?"
- Collect addresses from confirmed influencers

### Send Day (Mar 1)
- 25 PR boxes shipped
- Each box includes personal handwritten note or printed brand card
- Include a small card with IG handle + hashtag suggestion (not mandatory)
- Text "your box is on its way! 💛" with a photo of the packed box

### Post-Send (Mar 2-15)
- **Day 2-3:** "Has your box arrived?" check-in (casual, not pushy)
- **Day 5-7:** If they posted -- repost to stories with genuine thank you
- **Day 7-10:** If they haven't posted -- that's OK. Send a gentle "hope you're enjoying it! would love to know your fave flavor 🍫" 
- **Day 14:** Final soft touch -- "any favorites?" No pressure.
- **Never:** Ask why they didn't post. Never guilt trip.

### Repurposing Influencer Content
- Repost every influencer story/post to your stories (with credit)
- Screenshot and save for "As Seen On" highlights
- Create a carousel: "What SG creators are saying about Sweet Treat"
- With permission, use their photos/videos in your feed posts
- Save all UGC in a folder for website testimonials

## Sales Strategy

### Pre-Launch (Feb 17 - Mar 7)
- Build email list via "early access" Google Form (promote in stories)
- Instagram countdown sticker on every countdown story (people subscribe to notifications)
- "First 100 orders get free acrylic pens" -- announce Week 2

### Launch Day (Mar 8)
- 10:00 AM SGT launch
- Early access link to email list 1 hour before (9:00 AM)
- Instagram post + stories + TikTok simultaneously at 10:00 AM
- Pin launch post to top of IG grid
- Update link in bio to shop
- IG Shop + TikTok Shop live (products tagged in posts)

### Post-Launch (Mar 9+)
- Feature "X orders in first 24 hours" milestone (social proof)
- "Almost sold out" urgency when applicable
- Bundle offers: "Build your Sweet Treat box -- pick 3 shades"
- Restock announcements drive urgency
- Every influencer post = repost + "shop via link in bio"

### Pricing Psychology
- Individual lip ganache: $30
- Consider: "Sweet Treat Set" (all 5) at a slight discount -- drives higher AOV
- Free acrylic pens for first 100 = urgency + UGC potential (people post their designs)
