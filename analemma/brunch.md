# Launch Brunch -- Analemma ✦

## Concept
Intimate influencer brunch. Editorial, aesthetic, curated. Not a party -- a moment.
Vibe: ritual luxury meets golden hour. Think: Jaipur pinks, fresh botanicals, warm textures, natural light.

## Format
- **Type:** Seated brunch, curated guest list
- **Size:** 10-15 guests (micro-influencers + a few friends/creatives)
- **Duration:** ~2.5 hours
- **Target date:** Mid-September 2025 (Saturday or Sunday, 11am-1:30pm)

## Budget (Conservative)
| Item | Est. Cost |
|---|---|
| Venue (coffee shop, min spend or rental) | $200-500 |
| F&B (brunch menu or set package) | Included in venue or $150-300 |
| Florals / table styling | $100-200 |

## Venue Shortlist (TO RESEARCH)
- [ ] Venue 1: TBD
- [ ] Venue 2: TBD
- [ ] Venue 3: TBD
> Action: Research and email 5-8 cafes in SG with private dining / event space. Ask for: min spend, capacity, private area availability, brunch menu, availability in mid-Sep.

## Guest List Strategy
**Target: 10-15 people**
- 8-10 micro-influencers (5K-50K followers, SG-based, aligned aesthetic)
- 2-3 friends/creatives who will naturally post
- 1-2 "reach" invites (larger following, worth the ask)

**Influencer Criteria:**
- Singapore-based
- Aesthetic aligned: beauty, lifestyle, ritual, intentional living
- Engaged community (not just follower count)
- Actually uses/reviews products (not just gifted-post machines)
- Diverse representation

**Influencer Shortlist (TO BUILD)**
- [ ] Research 30-50 candidates
- [ ] Narrow to top 20
- [ ] Send invitations to 18-20 (expect ~60-70% acceptance)
> Action: Build spreadsheet with: name, handle, followers, engagement rate, aesthetic fit, contact info
