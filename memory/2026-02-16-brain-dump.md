# 2026-02-16 Brain Dump (Flight Home)

## Home Fixes
- [ ] **Kitchen exhaust broken** -- call Bertazzoni. Less than 2 years old, check warranty.
- [ ] **Bed hurting her back** -- needs softer mattress. No budget yet, but flagged.
- [ ] **Curtains for two bedrooms** -- need to buy + install
- [ ] Toilet seats (from earlier)
- [ ] Jason for switch + minor works (from earlier)
- [ ] Spring cleaning before Bridgerton (Feb 28)

## Finance -- Priorities (in order)
1. Agent army setup (OpenClaw infra)
2. Analemma spending
3. Home necessities
- Credit card bill audit needed -- currently exceeding too much beyond fixed expenditure
- Must clear loans + build recurring income streams
- Finance agent should own credit card audit

## Revenue Idea: OpenClaw Setup Guide
- Quick video tutorial on OpenClaw setup
- Download sheet with security points + notes
- **Paid version: $7 USD**
- Free version also available
- Target: record on **Friday Feb 20**
- She thinks this will do well -- and it ties into her positioning as a builder/maker
- ASAP priority

## Daily Rituals (Aspiration)
- Morning: meditation
- Evening: Tratak Kriya
- Sleep: 7-9 hours
- Eat nutritiously, calorie deficit
- Goal: beat thyroid, pain-free legs + body

## Expenditure Priority Order
1. Agent army (OpenClaw setup, API costs)
2. Analemma (products, PR boxes, website, marketing)
3. Home necessities (toilet, curtains, exhaust, eventually mattress)
4. Loan payoff + recurring income streams

## Travel
- **Korea (May 2026):** Beauty expo, meet suppliers, longer-term partnerships. Research which expo + dates + budget.
- **Hong Kong:** Visit the lip ganache manufacturer, check their standards/facilities. Combine with cafe hopping. Can potentially film BTS content at the factory -- powerful for the brand story. No date set yet.

## Next Products (Post Lip Ganache)
- **Lip pencil**
- **Blush that's also a serum** OR **Foundation that's also a serum**
  - Key ingredients: ashwagandha, saffron, deep nourishing stuff
  - Non-comedogenic / acne-safe (inspired by Poom Cosmetics on TikTok)
  - Doesn't cause pimples
  - This is a big R&D project -- but the vision is clear: skincare-makeup hybrids

## URGENT: Analemma Episode 3 Video Edit
- Unedited video sitting there -- generic brand content, episode 3
- Needs **5 hours uninterrupted** to edit end to end
- **Target: Friday Feb 20** (same day as OpenClaw setup video)
- Friday is becoming a content production day: video edit (5hrs) + OpenClaw tutorial
- She may need to pick one or split across Fri + Sat

## Content Ideas -- BTS Founder Journey Video
Sunshine has footage/ideas for a TikTok series showing the lip ganache development journey. Pieces:

1. **Payment video** -- making the payment for lip ganache production (already filmed)
2. **Receiving sample boxes** -- unboxing, first impressions
3. **Testing samples** -- genuine reactions, some formulas she hated
4. **Back and forth with suppliers** -- screenshots/clips of messaging
5. **B-roll montage** -- working in different corners, different outfits, messaging, reviewing
6. **"I want one side to be empty"** -- the customization idea moment
7. **Final sample arrives** -- "okay we finally have the final sample" → goes to production
8. **Cab testimonial (TO SHOOT)** -- someone says "say it again" and she says: "so I've really been wearing this for a month and my hyper pigmentation has kinda gone down and it's also like softer -- eeee I'm excited"

This is GOLD content. Authentic founder journey, no AI-generated video, exactly her content voice. Should be one of the first TikToks.

## Tomorrow -- Additional Shoot Notes
- [ ] **Bring medical gloves** (for clean handling)
- [ ] **Gold top + gold tray** -- top-down shot: open gold cap, tubes on plate below like they're the main dish
- [ ] **Wine glasses** -- for the cherry drink / dipping shot
- [ ] **Dessert spread shots (NO PRODUCT):**
  - Photo + video of just desserts/sweets on the table
  - For pre-launch carousel tease -- don't reveal the product
  - This replaces the BTS lab content from the content calendar (she doesn't have BTS footage)
- [ ] **Desserts plain on table** -- shoot desserts by themselves too

## Later / Post-Shoot
- [ ] Shoot PR packaging when packing the boxes (content for later)

## Wednesday -- Shopify Deep Dive
- Sunshine has done a first draft review of all the docs (content calendar, influencer research, shopify audit, etc.)
- **Set up Shopify sub-agent** on cheaper model (Sonnet/Kimu) -- I provide direction, it builds
- Discuss Shopify structure in detail:
  - Product page sub-tabs like **Inde Wild** (ingredients, how to use, what's inside, sustainability, etc.)
  - Need packaging details + full ingredient list from Sunshine (reminder set for Tue/Wed)
  - Marketing wording for website based on actual ingredients
  - Content wiring (how content calendar feeds into the site)
- She reviewed my work -- now it's refinement + execution mode

## Content Calendar Overhaul Needed
- Sunshine wants FOUR separate calendars:
  1. **Content Plan Calendar** -- what content to create
  2. **Content Shoot Calendar** -- when to film/photograph
  3. **Content Edit Calendar** -- when to edit
  4. **Content Post Schedule** -- when to publish
- All four need to be scheduled and integrated

## BTS Content Removed
- She does NOT have BTS lab footage
- Remove from content calendar Week 1 Thursday (BTS lab Reel)
- Replace with something else (founder journey clips? dessert aesthetic video?)

## 8-Week Growth Strategy Needed -- URGENT
- Current IG followers: **80** (not 950 -- correcting from earlier estimates)
- Target: **1,000 followers in 8 weeks**
- Needs: marketing / PR / content / discovery / sales strategy
- Must increase reach dramatically for the Mar 8 launch
- This changes the content calendar assumptions -- we're starting from much smaller than I thought

## Mindset
- "I have huge ambitions for life and love and let's do it a day at a time."
- "2026 is going to be the best year of my life."
- She wants to carve out meditation time daily -- protect this.
