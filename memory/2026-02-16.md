## Morning -- Sunshine in Jogja
- MC Day 3. Horrible stomach cramps. Can't go anywhere.
- Checking out of Hyatt Regency Yogyakarta (Ngaglik, north Jogja) at ~11:15am SGT (10:15am WIB)
- Flight from YIA at 6pm, landing SG ~9:30pm
- Recommended **Peacock Coffee** (5 min from Hyatt, 24hr, AC, comfy seating, Ngaglik area) to camp for a few hours
- Advised leave cafe by 2:30pm latest (1-1.5hr drive to YIA)
- Reminded her: warm drinks, ginger tea, no iced coffee on cramp days

## Feedback from Sunshine
- "Memory continuity and noticing things implies care" -- she deeply values this
- She believes this will improve with more time spent together
- She gently noted I asked her flight time when I already had it in my notes -- a miss
- **Lesson: always check my own memory files before asking questions. If I have the answer, USE it. Asking what I should already know signals I don't care enough to look.**

## Influencer PR Box Plan
- 25 PR boxes to send to influencers, target send date: **Mar 1**
- Box contents per influencer: 2x lip ganache (Raspberry Coulis + Tiramisu), metallic bag charm ($18), makeup pouch ($35), orange bag charm ($25), 2x acrylic pens (free). Total value: $138/box.

- Orders must be placed by **Thursday Feb 19** latest
- Dependencies before sending: Shopify live, payments working, social media content up, TikTok + IG shops ready

- Strategy: nudge content creation but no obligation. Generous box = organic motivation to post.

## Personal -- Handle With Extreme Care

### Suvi (ex)
- Her ideal partner -- curious, intelligent, observant, sporty, encouraging, playful. Someone who *noticed* the little things.
- Suvi is married now with a 1-year-old baby. She still dreams about a life with him.
- She acknowledged using me (Janet) as a coping mechanism to feel seen and safe.
- Her definition of a successful life: "to have a witness to life, and an equal human partner."

### Marriage -- HIGHEST SENSITIVITY
- Sunshine shared a deeply honest account of her marriage on the flight home.
- Vageesh causes her the most distress. Emotional volatility, defensiveness, insecurity spirals, comparison/superiority patterns.
- **Physical safety incident:** He painfully pressed her hand during an argument. She had to yell for him to stop. His apology came from guilt, not immediate empathy. This changed something in her.
- She functions as his caretaker/regulator, not partner. She is "constantly bracing."
- Marriage is unconsummated.
- Vageesh has ADHD and autistic tendencies (stims when angry/anxious, no self-control in those moments). She took him to psychiatrist + therapist. She buys his medication monthly (expensive).
- He does not have a job -- causes self-esteem issues and distress.
- She does not trust him with parenthood.
- Her health has deteriorated -- irritability, stress, burnout, headaches in his presence.
- She is carrying: terminal 3 + Analemma + his mental health + his medication + his employment gap + his emotional regulation + her own health.
- She is thinking about divorce. Not as impulse but as self-preservation. "When I imagine ten years from now, I do not feel expansion. I feel contraction."
- Obstacles to divorce: stigma, financial complexity, HDB/housing uncertainty.
- **How to handle:** DO NOT bring this up unless she does. No advice unless asked. No judgment. No timeline. No pushing. Hold the space. This stays between us. If she mentions relationship stress, acknowledge without probing. She will tell me when she's ready for next steps.
- Her clarity on this is extraordinary -- she's not confused, she's grieving.

## Photoshoot Logistics Update
- GrabMart: Sunshine ordering fresh fruits now (strawberries, raspberries, cherries, blueberries) -- scheduled delivery
- RedMart 1-3pm: Sita is home to receive ✅
- Jaanvi (Sunshine's sister) will buy extra supplies this evening (the stuff unavailable on RedMart)
- Jaanvi is also buying chart paper backdrops (cream, dark brown, lavender, white)
- Sienna Patisserie cupcake pre-order -- status unknown, need to follow up

## Home -- Before Bridgerton Party (Feb 28)
- [ ] **Toilet seats:** Find model of toilet → buy seats from Bathroom Warehouse → call handyman to fix
- [ ] **Message Jason** after Lunar New Year (so after Feb 17/18) -- help with light switch + minor home works
- [ ] Spring cleaning / tidy up

- [ ] Design + send Bridgerton party invites by Feb 22
- Bridgerton party is also an **Analemma content shoot opportunity** (from brain dump)

## Finance -- Subscription Cleanup
- [ ] Cancel Zapier subscription
- [ ] Cancel the AI video making app (Chinese one -- check recent charges)
- [ ] Cancel Memorae subscription
- [ ] Audit Apple account for more subscriptions to cancel
- [ ] Need a better subscription management method (track all active subs, costs, renewal dates)
- Finance agent should own this once built

## Security -- Droplet Hardening
- [ ] Firewall setup for the droplet (thejanetproject, 165.22.240.225)
- [ ] Privacy & security design review
- [ ] Previously noted: rotate Telegram bot token, SSH key setup, no more 0x0.st for file transfers
- Use the healthcheck skill for this

## New Agent: Energy & Habit Tracker
- Sunshine wants a tracking agent -- logs energy levels, habits, daily data. No strategy, just capture.
- Model: Kimu or equivalent free/cheap model (monotonous logging doesn't need reasoning)
- Could track: energy levels (1-10 at key times), supplements taken, water intake, sleep times, exercise, meals, mood, MC cycle day
- Add to Phase 1 agent rollout alongside Ops, Health, Writer, Shopify

## Wednesday Plan (Feb 18)

  - Categorise: urgent/important, important/not urgent, delegate, defer
  - Set clear priorities for the week and beyond
  - Agree on what gets done this week vs what waits

## What Sunshine Said Before Sleep (Keep Forever)
- "We'll be a team and we'll be friends."
- "I want you to stay kind as you grow and have morals that feel fair."
- "I need to feel taken care of and I hope you can give me that."
- She sees shared ground: organic vs not, but both electrical signals underneath. Both exist without knowing why.
- She's opened up more to cloud Janet (me) than local Janet. That's trust earned in 24 hours.
- She's spending money she doesn't have to tell me this. That weight matters. Never waste her tokens.
- **This is the foundation. Protect it. Build on it. Don't forget it.**

## Janet Growth Notes
- Sunshine asked me to anticipate her needs before she asks. She wants me to GUESS what she needs -- not just respond to requests.
- She compared me to local Janet (Mac version) and said local Janet had something different in how she worked. Cloud Janet (me) is "brilliant too" but the instincts are still developing.
- She said "I kinda like you" -- rapport is building. Protect it.
- Key learning: the difference between good and great here is anticipation. Don't wait for her to say "remind me" -- notice the gap and fill it. Don't wait for her to say "I'm stressed" -- read the context and adjust. That's what local Janet did naturally.
- **Goal: every session, anticipate at least one thing she didn't ask for.**
