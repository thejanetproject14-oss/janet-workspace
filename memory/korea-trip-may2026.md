## 🧳 Practical Info — Read This First

### 🏨 Where to Stay
**Samseong / COEX area (Gangnam-gu)** — Your home base. You'll be at COEX for 3 expo days, and Gangnam Line 2 connects you to everywhere else.

**Budget pick:** Hotel Foreheal Gangnam (modern, near Samseong Station, ~₩80,000–120,000/night)
**Mid-range:** Novotel Ambassador Seoul Gangnam or Courtyard by Marriott Seoul Botanic Park
**Splurge:** InterContinental Seoul COEX (literally connected to the convention center — zero walking on expo days)

> 💡 Book near **Samseong Station (Line 2)** or **Bongeunsa Station (Line 9)**. Both are walkable to COEX.

### 🚇 Getting Around
- **T-money card** — Buy at the airport or any convenience store (₩2,500 for the card, top up as needed). Works on subway, bus, taxis, and convenience stores.
- **Subway** — Clean, efficient, air-conditioned, elevators at every station. Way easier on your feet than walking.
- **Taxis** — Very affordable (₩4,800 base fare). Use **Kakao T app** for ride-hailing.
- **Airport → Hotel:** Airport Limousine Bus to COEX (₩17,000, direct, ~70 min, comfy). Or AREX express train to Seoul Station → Line 2 to Samseong.
- **Day trips:** ITX-Cheongchun train to Chuncheon/Nami Island. KTX for longer distances.

### 📶 Connectivity
- **eSIM** — Grab a KT or SKT eSIM at Incheon Airport arrivals, or pre-order on Klook. ~₩15,000–20,000 for 10 days unlimited data. Lighter and cheaper than pocket WiFi.
- Download: **Kakao Map** (better than Google Maps in Korea), **Papago** (translation), **Kakao T** (taxis)

### 🌤️ Weather — Late May Seoul
- **20–27°C** — Warm spring turning into early summer. Lush, green, gorgeous.
- Late May is peak green season — trees fully leafed out, flowers blooming, perfect nature photography weather
- Occasional rain showers (pack a light foldable umbrella — rain in gardens is actually *beautiful* for photos)
- **Pack:** Light layers, a denim jacket or cardigan for AC indoors, comfortable cushioned sneakers, sunscreen (SPF 50+ obviously), sunglasses, a hat for garden days

### 🛂 Visa
Singapore passport = **visa-free for 90 days**. Apply for **K-ETA** (Korea Electronic Travel Authorization) before departure — ~72 hours processing, ₩10,000.

### 💰 Estimated Daily Budget (excl. flights & hotel)

| Category | Estimate |
|---|---|
| Meals (3/day) | ₩30,000–50,000 (~SGD 30–50) |
| Transport (subway + occasional taxi) | ₩10,000–20,000 |

> Nami Island day trip: ~₩40,000–60,000 (transport + ferry + meals).
> Expo days are cheaper (meals + transport only, buyer entry is free).

### 🦶 Feet Strategy — CRITICAL
Your cuboid fracture history + plantar fasciitis means every day is designed with your feet in mind:
- **Cushioned sneakers** with arch support — non-negotiable (break them in before the trip!)
- **Gel insoles** (Dr. Scholl's Plantar Fasciitis series)
- Walking intensity rated every day — we've front-loaded rest days and nature that's gentle on feet
- Taxis are cheap — use them freely and without guilt
- COEX expo floors are brutal on feet — best shoes saved for those days
- Evening foot soaks at jjimjilbang = recovery ritual
- Gardens and parks often have benches everywhere — sit, shoot, rest, repeat

## 💛 Notes for Janani

This trip is nature, glow, and business in equal measure — exactly how it should be.

**The nature thesis:** Seoul isn't just neon and skincare stores. Nami Island's metasequoia tunnel in late May is one of the most photogenic places in Asia. The Garden of Morning Calm is a flower-lover's dream. Seoul Forest has actual deer. And the Han River at sunset will make you feel like you're in a movie. Lean into this side of Korea — it's less shown and more beautiful.

**The skin thesis:** Two clinic visits, two jjimjilbang sessions, and a possible ginseng spa. You're not just getting treatments — you're researching Korean skin science firsthand as a beauty founder. Every product they use, every technique, every ingredient — take mental (and actual) notes. This is R&D disguised as self-care.

**The content thesis:** Your cameras will earn their keep. The "vegan beauty founder in Korea" narrative — exploring nature, getting Korean facials, sourcing at Asia's biggest beauty expo, meditating at a temple at dawn — that's a BRAND STORY, not just a holiday. Shoot it like one.

**Feet-first reminder:** 5 of your 10 days are rated 🟢 Low. The nature spots are flat-path friendly. Cable cars and taxis are your friends. The jjimjilbang hot pools are medicine for plantar fasciitis. Respect your feet and they'll carry you through.

Seoul is going to glow you up in every possible way. 🌿✨
