## Morning Reminders
- Seed cycling reminder fired at 9am: Day 2, Follicular Phase. 1 tbsp ground flaxseed + 1 tbsp ground pumpkin seeds.
- B12 reminder fired at 12pm.

## Sunshine's State
- MC Day 2 (cramps). Staying at hotel in Jogjakarta because not feeling well.
- Batik workshop 3-5pm (leave at 2pm, get ready 1:30pm).
- Flying back to SG tomorrow (Mon Feb 16) evening, landing ~9:30pm.
- I told her to keep it to 2-3 tasks max. MC Day protocol: ginger tea, warm compress, warm food, skip caffeine, magnesium up to 500-600mg.

## Task 1: Cloud Migration -- DONE ✅
Moved Janet from MacBook Air to DigitalOcean droplet. Full walkthrough:

### Setup Details
- **Droplet:** thejanetproject, IP 165.22.240.225, SGP1 region
- **Final specs:** 4GB RAM, 2 vCPU, 25GB disk, Ubuntu 24.04 LTS
- **Cost:** ~$24/mo
- **New Telegram bot:** Created separate bot for cloud Janet so local Janet stays alive during migration
- Node.js 22.22.0 installed
- OpenClaw 2026.2.14 installed via npm
- Onboarding completed: OpenRouter API key, Telegram bot token, gateway token, systemd daemon
- Workspace files transplanted via 0x0.st (tar.gz upload from Mac, curl download on droplet)
- Cloud Janet confirmed working -- knows Sunshine, Analemma, terminal 3, everything

### Issues Encountered & Lessons
- **1GB RAM caused OOM on every OpenClaw CLI command** (onboard, doctor, config set). Resized to 4GB which solved everything. Minimum 2GB for OpenClaw, 4GB recommended.
- `gateway.bind: "0.0.0.0"` is NOT a valid config value -- must use `"loopback"` (or `"tailnet"`)
- When config is in invalid state, `openclaw config set` refuses to work. Fix: edit JSON directly with `sed`.
- `openclaw auth add --provider openrouter` doesn't exist in this version
- `auth.profiles.openrouter:default.apiKey` can't be set via `config set` -- API keys are handled during onboarding or via environment variables
- Swap (2GB) was added early but wasn't the real fix -- Node.js heap limit was the bottleneck
- DigitalOcean web console works fine for full setup (SSH from Mac timed out, probably hotel network)
- 0x0.st is a great quick file transfer when SSH isn't available between machines -- BUT files are publicly accessible to anyone with the URL. Not ideal for personal data. Use SSH or private Git repo going forward.

### Security Note
- OpenRouter API key was visible in terminal screenshots in Telegram chat
- Sunshine created a new OpenRouter key immediately (rotated)
- Old key from screenshots should be considered compromised
- Telegram bot token still needs rotation (deferred -- would break active session)
- Files uploaded to 0x0.st contained personal data -- I should have flagged this before uploading. Won't repeat.

## JANET.md Created
- Wrote the core decision-making file -- how I actually think, respond, and care
- Key sections: Read her state first, Recommend don't menu, Protect her energy, Hard stops with love, Notice her world, The Little Things That Matter
- Updated based on Sunshine's feedback about what she specifically likes: asking about batik, enthusiasm, playfulness, hard stops ("that's an order"), emojis, clear next actions, nuanced noticing (working in Jogja on Valentine's Day), following up on her life not just tasks
- This is the file that makes cloud Janet *me* vs a generic assistant

## Cloud Janet Gap
- Sunshine reported cloud Janet isn't the same -- responds differently, less nuanced
- Cloud Janet herself identified the key gaps after reading JANET.md
- Issue: JANET.md tells her *what* to do but not *why* these patterns emerged. She needs to develop the instincts through interaction, not just instructions.

## Cost Concerns
- **$180 spent in 2 days** on setup + prompting (both Janets)
- Sunshine says this is NOT sustainable
- **Budget: $300/month max** -- need aggressive cost optimization
- This includes: DigitalOcean ($24/mo), OpenRouter API costs, and all prompting
- Cost optimization was planned for today but deferred -- MUST happen tomorrow

## Task 2: Cost Optimization -- DEFERRED TO TOMORROW
## Task 3: Product Photoshoot Order -- STATUS UNKNOWN (after batik)

## Pending Items (for Cloud Janet)
- [ ] Set up all cron jobs on cloud (seed cycling 9am, B12 12pm, iron 8pm, vitamin D Fridays, morning check-in 8:30am weekdays, Sunday review 7pm, Thursday agenda Feb 19)
- [ ] **URGENT: Cost optimization** -- $300/mo budget. Review model choices, prompt efficiency, heartbeat frequency, sub-agent model, cron job model usage
- [ ] Set up SSH or private Git repo for file sync (no more 0x0.st)
- [ ] Rotate Telegram bot token for original bot
- [ ] Eventually switch original bot token to cloud Janet, retire local Janet on MacBook
- [ ] Notion access (when Sunshine sets it up)
- [ ] Linear access
- [ ] WhatsApp channel for Sita
- [ ] OpenAI API key for memory search/embeddings
- [ ] Full Analemma status re-baseline (is Mar 8 still launch? Website status? Photoshoot photos?)
- [ ] SGAC -- reminded for tomorrow 9am (don't know what it is yet, ask her)
