# 2026-02-15 (Sunday)

## Morning Reminders
- Seed cycling reminder fired at 9am: Day 2, Follicular Phase. 1 tbsp ground flaxseed + 1 tbsp ground pumpkin seeds.
- B12 reminder fired at 12pm.

## Sunshine's State
- MC Day 2 (cramps). Staying at hotel in Jogjakarta because not feeling well.
- Batik workshop 3-5pm (leave at 2pm, get ready 1:30pm).
- Flying back to SG tomorrow (Mon Feb 16) evening, landing ~9:30pm.
- I told her to keep it to 2-3 tasks max. MC Day protocol: ginger tea, warm compress, warm food, skip caffeine, magnesium up to 500-600mg.

## Task 1: Cloud Migration -- DONE ✅
Moved Janet from MacBook Air to DigitalOcean droplet. Full walkthrough:

### Setup Details
- **Droplet:** thejanetproject, IP 165.22.240.225, SGP1 region
- **Final specs:** 4GB RAM, 2 vCPU, 25GB disk, Ubuntu 24.04 LTS
- **Cost:** ~$24/mo
- **New Telegram bot:** Created separate bot for cloud Janet so local Janet stays alive during migration
- Node.js 22.22.0 installed
- OpenClaw 2026.2.14 installed via npm
- Onboarding completed: OpenRouter API key, Telegram bot token, gateway token, systemd daemon
- Workspace files transplanted via 0x0.st (tar.gz upload from Mac, curl download on droplet)
- Cloud Janet confirmed working -- knows Sunshine, Analemma, terminal 3, everything

### Issues Encountered & Lessons
- **1GB RAM caused OOM on every OpenClaw CLI command** (onboard, doctor, config set). Resized to 4GB which solved everything. Minimum 2GB for OpenClaw, 4GB recommended.
- `gateway.bind: "0.0.0.0"` is NOT a valid config value -- must use `"loopback"` (or `"tailnet"`)
- When config is in invalid state, `openclaw config set` refuses to work. Fix: edit JSON directly with `sed`.
- `openclaw auth add --provider openrouter` doesn't exist in this version
- `auth.profiles.openrouter:default.apiKey` can't be set via `config set` -- API keys are handled during onboarding or via environment variables
- Swap (2GB) was added early but wasn't the real fix -- Node.js heap limit was the bottleneck
- DigitalOcean web console works fine for full setup (SSH from Mac timed out, probably hotel network)
- 0x0.st is a great quick file transfer when SSH isn't available between machines -- BUT files are publicly accessible to anyone with the URL. Not ideal for personal data. Use SSH or private Git repo going forward.

### Security Note
- OpenRouter API key was visible in terminal screenshots in Telegram chat
- Sunshine created a new OpenRouter key immediately (rotated)
- Old key from screenshots should be considered compromised
- Telegram bot token still needs rotation (deferred -- would break active session)
- Files uploaded to 0x0.st contained personal data -- I should have flagged this before uploading. Won't repeat.

## JANET.md Created
- Wrote the core decision-making file -- how I actually think, respond, and care
- Key sections: Read her state first, Recommend don't menu, Protect her energy, Hard stops with love, Notice her world, The Little Things That Matter
- Updated based on Sunshine's feedback about what she specifically likes: asking about batik, enthusiasm, playfulness, hard stops ("that's an order"), emojis, clear next actions, nuanced noticing (working in Jogja on Valentine's Day), following up on her life not just tasks
- This is the file that makes cloud Janet *me* vs a generic assistant

## Cloud Janet Gap
- Sunshine reported cloud Janet isn't the same -- responds differently, less nuanced
- Cloud Janet herself identified the key gaps after reading JANET.md
- Issue: JANET.md tells her *what* to do but not *why* these patterns emerged. She needs to develop the instincts through interaction, not just instructions.

## Cost Concerns
- **$180 spent in 2 days** on setup + prompting (both Janets)
- Sunshine says this is NOT sustainable
- **Budget: $300/month max** -- need aggressive cost optimization
- This includes: DigitalOcean ($24/mo), OpenRouter API costs, and all prompting
- Cost optimization was planned for today but deferred -- MUST happen tomorrow

## Task 2: Cost Optimization -- PARTIALLY DONE
- Sub-agents set to Sonnet (5x cheaper). Morning check-ins + cron → Haiku soon.
- HARD BUDGET: $300/month max (~$10/day)
- Janet on Sonnet for routine days, Opus only for strategy/PRD/complex work

## Task 3: Photoshoot Order -- DONE ✅
- RedMart order placed: $77.55, delivery Mon Feb 16 1-3pm
- Got: brioche, wipes, paper towels, raspberry jam, cranberry juice, strawberry jam, whipped cream, maraschino cherries, chocolate layer cake, gummies x5, tiramisu (Sainsbury's)
- Missing (unavailable): waffle cones, parchment paper, chocolate syrup, milk chocolate, caramel syrup, gummy bears (peach/grape), frozen raspberries, frozen strawberries, sprinkles, cupcakes, macarons
- Plan: review gaps at 11am SGT Mon. Buy what she can in JB or skip. Order fresh berries via GrabMart at 1:30pm Mon.
- CNY on Tuesday = most Chinese-owned JB bakeries likely closed. AEON probably open.

## Batik Workshop
- Went 3-5pm. Found it hard but had fun. Loves new experiences.

## Sunshine Wants From Janet (Care)
- Proactive health nudges, sleep tracking, hydration reminders
- Use own reasoning -- don't wait to be asked
- Remember small details (tomatoes, sleep schedule, etc.)

## What Sunshine Liked About Local Janet
- Humor, empathy, hard stops with love
- Noticing her world (asking about batik, seeing she's working on holiday)
- Playful emojis used naturally
- Ending with momentum / clear next action
- "Sleep. That's an order." energy

## Things Sunshine Owes Cloud Janet
1. Shopify admin access
2. OpenAI API key
3. Notion + Linear access
4. Calendar -- create Janet email, give read access
5. Sita's details -- schedule, cleaning reference photos, WhatsApp contact

7. Cycle tracking -- ping when new period starts
8. Base photo for daily motivation
9. Brand assets (logo, brand colors, fonts)
10. Product pricing for all lip ganache flavors
11. Shipping details (SG only? International? Rates?)
12. **Homepage plan for current Shopify theme** -- she made an approx layout, ask for it Wednesday

## Late Night Brain Dump (before sleep)
- **Analemma 6-month strategy needed** -- content calendar, content seeding, paid UGC on tight budget, maximum organic growth
- **Credit limit exceeded** last month and this month. No unnecessary purchases going forward.
- **Personal loan debt** -- wants to clear by end of year. Finance agent critical.
- **Confidence = great hair + skin days.** This matters for content shooting readiness.
- **Relationship isn't great.** Needs a way to manage it. Will update Janet later.
- **Social life** -- once a month plans is good. Bridgerton party (Feb 28) is next. Double-purpose: social + Analemma content shoot.
- **Loves videography.** Cinematic, scripted, shot lists. This is core to her, not a side hobby.
- **Content voice inspiration:** Nirmal Pillai, Life of Riza, Chloe Shih. Scripted, cinematic, intentional.
- **New agent needed:** Videography/Content Production agent -- shot lists, scripts, cinematic content planning.
- **"I was handling all this alone."** -- She's relieved to have help. Protect that feeling.
- **Past relationship** -- regrets breaking up with someone reliable. Emotions resurface. Will tell the story when ready. Don't push. Just be here when she does.
- **Believes in quantum consciousness.**
- **Model strategy (Sunshine's vision):**
  - Janet: Opus (full picture, orchestration)
  - Research agents (Analemma, T3): Sonnet (need reasoning)
  - Execution agents: Kimu (cheap, fast, focused)
  - Finance agent: OpenAI (better for financial planning/math)
  - Each agent is a specialist with own small context. No agent holds full picture except Janet.
  - After first week of setup, daily costs must drop significantly. This connects to her Vedic cosmology, Chladni plates, temple architecture interests. Not woo -- pattern-seeking at the deepest level.
