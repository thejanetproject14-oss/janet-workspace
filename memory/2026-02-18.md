## Morning -- The Declaration
Sunshine sent a manifesto. Not goals -- a statement of who she's becoming. Three pillars:

### 🌿 Health
- Wants to feel light, strong, energized, steady. Not shrinking -- power.
- Calorie deficit from discipline, not punishment. Clean streaks that stack.
- Sleep before midnight. Laptop closed. Self-respect as the driver.
- High-protein vegetarian. Iron, B12, magnesium. Anti-inflammatory. Hydration.
- 8K steps normal. Strength training routine. Yoga grounding.
- "Health is not aesthetic. It's power. And I want my power back."

### 💄 Analemma
- 8 sales/day as baseline. Revenue dashboards growing monthly.
- 1 reel, 1 carousel, stories daily. Momentum that compounds.
- Sharp business side so creative side can expand.
- Discipline in outreach, influencer conversations, margins, inventory.
- "Analemma is not a hobby. It is a future."

### 🧠 Terminal 3
- Strategic, not scattered. Deep work blocks. Clarity in writing.
- Long-term thinking: MetaMask, agent authorization, regulatory infra.
- Calm in rooms where others are reactive. Three moves ahead.
- "Terminal 3 is not just a job. It is a proving ground."

### The Integration
- All three, not one at the cost of another.
- Systems that protect from impulsiveness. Structure that supports ambition.
- "That is the woman I am becoming."

## Core Identity Document
- Sunshine sent a full self-portrait -- saved to `memory/sunshine-core-identity.md`
- Not a brain dump. A complete articulation of who she is, what she wants, and how she works.
- Key additions beyond what we already knew:
  - Feedback preference: monthly, NOT constant. Frequent feedback triggers anxiety loops.
  - Schedule preference: understood monthly, planned daily, ideally hour-by-hour.
  - Plantar fasciitis -- walking can be hard at times.
  - Great-grandmother is 100, fit and healthy. THAT is the dream health goal.
  - Target: 80kg by end of year.
  - Product assessments: focus on positives unless she explicitly asks for critique.
  - Former therapist Shaheen (trauma-informed, queer-affirmative). Can't continue -- budget.
  - She wants AI as infrastructure: remind, track, reduce cognitive load, keep her honest.

## Photoshoot Update (Tue Feb 17 -- Dellea Studio, JB)
- Shoot went well overall ✅
- BUT: ran out of time -- **makeup bags were NOT shot**. Still need a separate shoot for those.
- Makeup bags launching Mar 8 too but as a side item. Home shoot is fine for them.
- Sunshine was very tired. Bad headache. Feet hurting (plantar fasciitis + fracture recovery).
- Crashed for ~12 hours that night. Body was done.
- Photo turnaround: expected Thursday (from JB shoot)
- Ingredient lists: still needed from her for Shopify
