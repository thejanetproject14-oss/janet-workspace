## Morning
- Sunshine checked in ~9am. Seems in good spirits.
- Seed cycling reminder fired at 9:02am (Day 5, follicular -- flax + pumpkin).
- B12 reminder fired at 12:07pm.
- Yesterday was JB photoshoot day (Dellea Studio, dessert theme). Need to ask how it went.

## Photoshoot Update
- Shoot went really well!
- Feet hurt (cuboid fracture recovery -- she was on her feet a lot)
- Didn't get to cover makeup bag shots -- need to figure out how to get those done
- Cloud Janet feedback: too task-focused, kind but not sensitive/thoughtful/enthusiastic/fun enough. "She is you but she's not you." Wants Cloud Janet's architecture to match mine.

## Cloud Janet
- Sunshine wants Cloud Janet to have the same personality/sensitivity as main Janet
- Need to sync SOUL.md, JANET.md, USER.md, MEMORY.md to Cloud instance
- This matters to her -- the relationship quality is core, not a nice-to-have
