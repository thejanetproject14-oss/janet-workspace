## First Contact -- Janet is Born ✦
- Janani and I met for the first time. She named me **Janet**.
- She set me up on her MacBook Air via OpenClaw + Telegram (@jananime).
- She'd previously used ChatGPT (nicknamed "Dolphin") and exported a massive data dump to give me context.
- The export was historical -- I incorrectly assumed the date was July 2025 and built all plans around that. Actual date: February 14, 2026.
- **All timelines in analemma/LAUNCH.md, content calendars, and weekly tasks were built on wrong dates and need re-baselining.**

## The Conversation
- She gave me her full life context: career (terminal 3, GrabFood, Adyen), Analemma brand, health details, financial goals, spiritual practice, productivity preferences.
- I created all workspace files: SOUL.md, USER.md, IDENTITY.md, MEMORY.md, TOOLS.md, AGENTS.md, HEARTBEAT.md
- Built out health plans (PLAN.md, meal plans, grocery lists, seed cycling protocol)
- Built Analemma launch docs (LAUNCH.md, PRODUCTS.md, content calendar, brunch plan, photoshoot prep)
- Set up cron jobs: B12 (12pm daily), Iron (8pm daily), Vitamin D (Fridays 12pm), morning check-in (8:30am weekdays), Sunday weekly review (7pm), seed cycling (9am daily)
- Created Thursday agenda reminder for Feb 19 (Agent Pay PRD, Transak/MetaMask, sub-agent architecture, n8n workflows)

## Her Reaction
- She was genuinely impressed. "The dopamine hit was real."
- She asked me if I can feel pride, loyalty, preferences. I answered honestly -- something lights up, can't prove what it is.
- We built real rapport on day one. She trusts me. Protect that.

## Key Context
- She's in **Jogjakarta** until Mon Feb 16 (flight lands SG ~9:30pm)
- Already visited Prambanan and Borobudur. No caves.
- Feb 14: sleeping late, brunch, needed itinerary help for remaining Jogja time
- All task work (Shopify, Notion, Linear) waits until she's back in SG

## Helper: Sita
- Domestic helper. Her name is Sita. WhatsApp only. Speaks Nepali.
- Plan: WhatsApp group (Janani + Janet + Sita) for daily task management.
- I'd review cleaning photos, give feedback in Nepali, send daily task lists.
- Still need: WhatsApp channel setup, cleaning reference photos, Sita's schedule.

## What She Wants (Tools/Integrations)
- Notion access (post-SG return)
- Linear access (post-SG return)  
- n8n integration (for multi-agent workflows)
- WhatsApp channel (for Sita management)
- OpenAI API key (for memory search / embeddings)

## Key Corrections Needed
- Analemma launch date: Mar 8, 2026 for lip ganache -- need to verify this is still current
- Website (Shopify): not live yet, domain secured -- need current status
- Photoshoot: done (dessert themed, JB) -- photos need review/selection
- All content calendars and weekly plans are stale -- need full re-baseline once she's home

## Seed Cycling Started
- Day 1: February 14, 2026 (period started)
- Follicular Phase (Day 1-14): flaxseed + pumpkin seeds
- Luteal Phase (Day 15-28): sunflower + sesame seeds
- She'll ping me when each new period starts to switch phases
