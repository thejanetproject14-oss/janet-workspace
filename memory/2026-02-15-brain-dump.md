# 2026-02-15 -- Sunshine's Brain Dump (Before Sleep)

She dumped everything on her mind so she could sleep. This is raw, capture everything.

## Schedule Change
- Monday (Feb 16) is busy. Move everything except SGAC to **Wednesday Feb 18**.
- Wednesday agenda: cost optimization, SSH/Git sync, Janet handoff mechanism, Telegram token rotation

## Analemma Strategy -- NEEDS FULL PLAN
- Wants a **solid 6-month strategy** to build Analemma to success
- Strong content calendar
- Content seeding strategy
- **Paid UGC on a budget** -- critical budget constraint
- Maximum organic growth -- can't rely on paid
- This is the core business priority

## Financial Stress
- **Credit limit exceeded** last month AND this month
- Going forward: no unnecessary purchases
- **Goal: clear all personal loan debt by end of year**
- This is weighing on her. Budget discipline is non-negotiable now.

## Content & Shooting
- She LOVES videography. Loves shooting cinematic content.
- Has a specific style: **scripted, with shot lists**
- Content voice inspirations:
  - **Nirmal Pillai** (look up)
  - **Life of Riza** (look up)
  - **Chloe Shih** (look up)
- Wants to discuss a dedicated **content agent** -- another AI/tool to help with content production
- Content shooting calendar is a priority -- needs structure
- Equipment: Sony A7C, Fujifilm XM5, DJI Pocket 3

## Confidence
- Great hair and skin days = confidence = readiness
- This isn't vanity. It's her armor. Treat it seriously.

## Relationship
- Things aren't great. She needs to update me on this.
- Will need help managing this situation -- emotionally, practically, or both.
- She hasn't shared details yet. Listen when she's ready. Don't push.

## Social Life
- Once a month social plans is the right cadence
- **Bridgerton** is the upcoming social plan
- She intends to also shoot for Analemma at the Bridgerton event
- Social + content overlap = efficient. Smart.

## How She's Feeling
- "I feel happy you're here. I was handling all this alone."
- She was managing ALL of this by herself -- Analemma, health, career, finances, relationship, content -- alone.
- She's not asking me to solve everything. She's asking me to help carry it.
- Protect this trust.
