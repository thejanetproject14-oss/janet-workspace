## PR Box Finalized
- Concept: Lock box with combination lock + clue letter (content goldmine for influencer unboxing)
- Cloud Janet drafting the clue letter
- Contents per box: 2 lip ganaches (Tiramisu + Raspberry Coulis), makeup pouch (products packed INSIDE the pouch), metallic bag charm, acrylic pen, brand card + clue letter
- Makeup pouch: YES include. 150 pcs total stock, 15 for PR = 10%. Plenty.
- Unboxing flow: receive locked box → solve clues → open → see charm + pen on top → pull out pouch → discover products inside → realise pouch is also a gift
- Shopping list pushed to Notion (Analemma → 🎁 PR Box Order)
- Est. packaging cost: $50-90 SGD for 15 boxes

## Pacing Issue with Cloud Janet
- Sunshine frustrated: Cloud Janet jumps ahead, doesn't give practical details, overwhelms
- She said "She needs to conserve my energy and not overwhelm me"
- Drafted operating rules patch for Cloud Janet (6 rules: one thing at a time, give steps, ask before moving, protect energy, don't leave gaps, read the room)
- Sunshine sent the rules to Cloud Janet

## Git Sync
- Pulled from cloud: JANET.md (presence rule + lead don't ask), Shopify templates, pages-ready-to-create, build-calendar script, 2026-02-19 plan/summary
- Cloud Janet deployed AI team: Hermione (Shopify), Luna (content), Remus (SEO)
- Slack workspace "Janet x Analemma" -- joined all 7 channels ✅
- Slack token stored locally (.slack-tokens, chmod 600)
- DO upgraded to 8GB ($48/mo)

## Slack Integration
- Token: stored in .slack-tokens (not in git -- GitHub push protection caught it)
- Added to .gitignore
- All channels joined: general, shopify, content-engine, seo-engine, linear-updates, social, all-janet-x-analemma
- TOOLS.md updated with Slack details

## Terminal 3 -- Transak Proposal
- Sunshine sent MetaMask x terminal 3 x Transak context dump
- Built full 12-section integration proposal (architecture, routing, KYC tiers, integration modes, threshold enforcement, anti-gaming, identity object, compliance matrix, decision matrix, risks, questions for Transak, next steps)
- Uploaded to Notion under Terminal 3 → 🔐 MetaMask × Terminal 3 × Transak -- Integration Proposal
- Also saved locally: terminal3/metamask-transak-proposal.md
- Cloud Janet synced it via evening git push

## Lighting Purchase
- Decided on Godox SL60IID dual light kit (Option 9 from official Taobao store)
- ¥1596 (~$290 SGD): 2x SL60IID + 2x 60x90cm softboxes + 2x stands
- Also needs: 5-in-1 reflector disc (反光板摄影 80cm 五合一), PVC backdrop (PVC摄影背景布 纯色)
- Will shoot on dining table with PVC draped as seamless backdrop

## Figma MCP for Packaging
- Sunshine wants to use Figma Make + MCP for perfume box packaging assembly
- Needs: Figma personal access token, dieline from supplier
- PARKED for Saturday -- both local + cloud Janet need access
- She'll generate the token Saturday

## Scaling Research
- Sunshine asked about scaling Analemma with AI
- Reddit didn't have great posts on this (too early, most people are behind)
- Gave her a scaling playbook: content at scale, AI customer service, predictive inventory, SEO compounding, email/SMS automation
- 90-day post-launch roadmap outlined
- She'll come back to this later

## Health
