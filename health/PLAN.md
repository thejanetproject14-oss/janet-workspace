## Goals (Priority Order)
1. Reduce inflammation (root cause of most symptoms)
2. Fix iron + B12 deficiency
3. Optimize thyroid (lower TSH naturally)
4. Reduce bloating
5. Lower cortisol / improve sleep onset
6. Reduce body fat (stomach, hips, thighs) -> UK size 12
7. Build toward half marathon (1-year horizon)

## Diet Framework
- **Vegetarian** | No eggs | No mushrooms | Dairy OK
- Anti-inflammatory focus
- High micronutrient density: zinc, magnesium, iron, selenium, omega-3, protein

## Exercise Plan (Rebuilding Phase)

**Weekly Structure:**
| Day | Activity | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Mon | Walk (8K steps) + Weights (upper body, 30 min) | Light dumbbells, wrist-friendly exercises |
| Tue | Yoga class | Use forearm support for wrist; inform teacher |
| Wed | Walk (8K steps) + Weights (lower body, 30 min) | Squats, lunges, hip thrusts -- careful on foot |
| Thu | Walk (8K steps) | Active recovery day |
| Fri | Yoga class | |
| Sat | Walk (8K steps) + Weights (full body, 30 min) | |
| Sun | Rest or gentle walk | |

**Modifications:**
- Wrist: use fists/forearm support in yoga, wrist wraps for weights
- Foot: proper supportive footwear, build walking distance gradually
- Start weights light -- form over load
- Track steps daily (Apple Health / phone)

**Half Marathon Ramp (starts Month 3+):**
- Build walking base first (8K daily for 8 weeks)
- Add walk/jog intervals in Month 3
- Structured Couch-to-Half plan in Month 4+
