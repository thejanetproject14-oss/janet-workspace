## Nutrient Highlights Per Day (Approximate)

## Anti-Bloating Notes
- All lentils/legumes: soak minimum 6-8 hours, cook with cumin + ajwain
- Moong dal is lightest on digestion -- use it more on high-bloat days
- Add fennel seeds to cooking or drink fennel tea after meals
- Avoid raw salads at dinner (cook vegetables instead)
- Buttermilk with lunch aids digestion (cumin, salt, curry leaves)
