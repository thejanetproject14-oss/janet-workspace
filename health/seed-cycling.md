# Seed Cycling Protocol ✦

Seed cycling supports hormonal balance by rotating specific seeds across the two phases of your menstrual cycle.

## How It Works

### Phase 1: Follicular Phase (Day 1 to Ovulation, ~Day 1-14)
**Seeds:** 1 tbsp ground **flaxseed** + 1 tbsp ground **pumpkin seeds** daily

- **Flaxseed:** Contains lignans that help modulate estrogen. Rich in omega-3 (ALA).
- **Pumpkin seeds:** High in zinc, which supports progesterone production for the next phase.

### Phase 2: Luteal Phase (Ovulation to Period, ~Day 15-28)
**Seeds:** 1 tbsp ground **sunflower seeds** + 1 tbsp ground **sesame seeds** daily

- **Sesame seeds:** Contain lignans that help regulate estrogen. Rich in zinc.
- **Sunflower seeds:** High in selenium and vitamin E, which support progesterone and liver detox.

## How to Take
- **Grind fresh** (or buy pre-ground, store in fridge). Whole seeds pass through undigested.
- Add to: smoothies, yogurt, oatmeal, dal, salads, or just eat with a spoon + honey.
- Take with food. Consistent daily intake matters more than timing within the day.
- Best to grind a week's worth at a time, keep in airtight jar in the fridge.

## Tracking
- Need to know Day 1 of each cycle to switch phases
- Sunshine to update Janet when period starts each month
- Janet switches the seed reminder accordingly

## Current Cycle
- Day 1: February 14, 2026
- Phase 1 (Follicular): Feb 14 -- ~Feb 27 → flaxseed + pumpkin seeds
- Phase 2 (Luteal): ~Feb 28 -- next period → sunflower seeds + sesame seeds

## Shopping (add to regular grocery list)
- Ground flaxseed (or whole + grinder)
- Pumpkin seeds (raw, unsalted)
- Sunflower seeds (raw, unsalted)
- Sesame seeds (raw)
- All available at Saastha or FairPrice

## Anti-Cramp Protocol (Days 1-3)
Things that can help reduce the pain over time:

**Supplements (start now, effects build over 2-3 cycles):**
- Magnesium glycinate 400mg (already in your stack -- helps muscle relaxation + cramps)
- Omega-3 (already in stack -- anti-inflammatory, reduces prostaglandins)
- Vitamin B6: 50mg daily during luteal phase -- reduces PMS symptoms
- Evening primrose oil: 1000mg during luteal phase -- GLA supports prostaglandin balance

**During period (Days 1-3):**
- Magnesium dose can go up to 500-600mg (split across day)
- Ginger tea -- anti-inflammatory, clinically shown to reduce menstrual pain
- Turmeric golden milk (turmeric + black pepper + warm milk)
- Warm compress on lower abdomen
- Gentle movement: slow walk (even 10-15 min), gentle yoga (child's pose, cat-cow, supine twist) -- NOT intense
- Avoid: caffeine (constricts blood vessels), cold drinks, heavy/hard-to-digest food
- Favor: warm, soupy, easy-to-digest meals (khichdi, rasam, dal rice, warm soups)

**Lifestyle shifts that help long-term:**
- Consistent seed cycling (effects show after 2-3 cycles)
- Regular exercise through the month (reduces cramp severity over time)
- Anti-inflammatory diet (you're already on this track)
- Stress management (cortisol disrupts progesterone -- you have elevated cortisol, this connects)

**MC Day Task Approach:**
- Don't aim for zero. Aim for 30% capacity.
- 1-2 small, satisfying tasks (reading, planning, light digital work)
- No high-energy meetings or decisions if possible
- Rest is productive. Recovery IS the work on these days.
