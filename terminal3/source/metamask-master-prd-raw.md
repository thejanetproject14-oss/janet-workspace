If marked in orange , it represents that this is TO BE CONFIRMED with MetaMask/Transak

## Background & Context 

### **1\. MetaMask project positioning & Priority** 

MetaMask is described internally as:

* One of the largest projects Terminal 3 has gotten since inception.  
* A major “trust signal” for a three-year-old company.  
* Supported by leadership   
* Quality and maturity perception matters and our deliverables must cater to those expectations

Why MetaMask is interested:

* Privacy-preserving emails and analytics.  
* Reusable KYC.  
* Desire to own the user relationship across providers while maintaining the privacy preservation philosophy   
* Desire to become more like Coinbase/Kraken/Robinhood (unified experience) while still being Web3-native.

MetaMask’s longer-term vision:

* A unified identity layer for users across products (on/off ramp, card, trading, equities/perps/prediction).  
* Reduce friction where users have to KYC multiple times.  
* A unified “MetaMask ID” concept.  
* Unified KYC tiers.  
* Possibly global user ID effort internally at MetaMask

## **2\. Primary flows discussed and their priority**

* Two MetaMask user flows repeatedly discussed:  
  * **Deposit flow** (highest priority) \- internally called as Native Flow  
  * **Buy/Sell crypto flow** (fast follow after deposit) \- Non-native Flow / Web view flow  
* Priority order repeatedly stated:  
  * Deposit flow first  
  * Buy/sell crypto next  
  * Later: login, other providers, wallet settings page, longer-term features  
* Countries:  
  * Initial focus: US and EU  
  * UK expected expansion by March (MetaMask mentioned)  
  * New York excluded due to license  
  * EU flow not fully captured due to VPN/access issues  
* Deposit button visibility issues:  
  * Deposit button not visible for many testers.  
  * MetaMask restricted deposit visibility due to conversion issues before holiday season (2025).  
  * Deposit experience still exists but routing changed based on region and whether user has historical orders.  
  * For US new users, MetaMask routes to embedded Transak experience.  
  * For returning users, MetaMask might route directly to previous provider (example MoonPay) to avoid revenue drop.  
  * To view deposit flow: US VPN needed, not New York; still sometimes not working (NordVPN issues).

## **3\. Transak flow behavior and account binding**

* Observed Transak flow behavior:  
  * Email OTP is used to log into Transak.  
  * Transak account appears tied to email and SSN constraints.  
  * SSN cannot be reused to create multiple Transak accounts.  
  * Users can log into the same Transak account across different MetaMask accounts, but cannot create multiple Transak accounts for same SSN.  
* SSN and account relationship:  
  * Error observed: “SSN already linked to another account.”  
  * This is triggered when trying to create a new Transak account with same SSN.  
  * Discussion that this is expected behavior like a bank.  
  * Confusion and exploration: does MetaMask restrict it or does provider (Transak) restrict it.  
* Terminal 3 side decisions discussed:  
  * Need a check so users cannot create multiple Terminal 3 accounts for same identity.  
  * Duplicate KYC detection feature being implemented.  
  * Need ability to toggle duplication detection per client.  
  * Need to clarify whether KYC is linked to MetaMask wallet, MetaMask account, or Terminal 3 account.

## **4\. MetaMask wallet and account hierarchy changes**

* MetaMask model as described:  
  * MetaMask has changed account model:  
    * Wallets can contain multiple accounts.  
    * Each account has an EVM address and also Solana and Bitcoin address.  
    * One account equals one EVM address (plus Solana/Bitcoin).  
  * You can create multiple wallets and multiple accounts inside each wallet.  
  * You can import wallet, import account, add hardware wallet.  
* Confusion point:  
  * Terminal 3 historically treats “wallet” as an address.  
  * MetaMask terminology now differs: wallet houses multiple accounts.  
* Consequences discussed:  
  * KYC attaching to login does not map cleanly because MetaMask has no login.  
  * KYC might need to attach to MetaMask “wallet” level rather than “account/address” level.  
  * User should be able to reinstall MetaMask and recover on-chain assets. If KYC is attached wrongly, it could block recovery flows.

## **KYC tiers observed and debated**

* KYC tier counts:  
  * Many conversations: two levels observed.  
  * Some mention of potential third level but not seen.  
* Threshold behavior:  
  * Conflicting observations:  
    * Early test suggested everyone needs Level 2\.  
    * Later MetaMask call summary: threshold above 150 USD triggers liveness and document verification.  
    * Below threshold might be just user input (SSN).  
* KYC Level 1 fields observed in buy/sell:  
  * Address and phone number.  
  * Purpose/AML question asked in buy/sell flow (not in deposit native flow).  
* KYC Level 2:  
  * Involves Onfido in current MetaMask flow.  
  * Document types: passport, national ID, driver’s license.  
  * Liveness selfie.  
* Complexity:  
  * Variation by region and product.  
  * Need to model KYCT tiers per client and per region.  
  * Discussion that Binance/Coinbase have stricter KYC due to legal compliance.  
  * Concern that Transak may not match compliance rigor.

## **UX and UI constraints from KYC providers**

* Veriff limitations:  
  * No dark mode in Veriff (according to discussion).  
  * Branding:  
    * Veriff logo cannot be removed from bottom.  
    * Loading/waiting page shows Veriff logo and cannot be replaced with spinner easily.  
    * Out-of-box config allows color and typography changes, limited assets.  
    * Additional customization likely costs extra.  
* Need to match MetaMask UI:  
  * Deposit flow is MetaMask-branded.  
  * Buy/sell webview flow less branded at the moment, T3 to make it to MetaMask branding.   
  * T3 to suggest native flow these flows as well for better user experience. 

## **KYC duplication detection and identity linking**

* Duplicate KYC detection:  
  * Implementing internal detection, configurable per client.  
  * Providers like Onfido and Veriff have duplication signals but may require enterprise plan.  
  * Need to decide whether duplication is email-based, passport-based, wallet-based.  
* Identity mismatch and corrections:  
  * Providers often misparse names.  
  * Suggestion: allow user to confirm parsed first, middle, last name before proceeding.

## Roadmap & Milestones 

Pilot with MetaMask : [**Native Flow (refer the correct document tab for the product requirements)**](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1f67hxBB-koVFnHUj21UjjLTeQc8AmqrfLf6zYpv1qv0/edit?tab=t.1krkami6kn00)   
**\[After discussion with MetaMask Product team, we have aligned that we will first deliver the Native Flow for Transak \- for US & EU jurisdictions\]** 

**Expected Completion Date** : 28 February 2026   
**Current dependency** : MSA signature to proceed to conversations with Transak 

| Date | Week | Focus | Milestones / Priorities for the Week |
| ----- | ----- | ----- | ----- |
| **Jan 5 \- Jan 9** | **Week 1** | **Scope lock \+ Entry conditions \+ Integration with veriff** | **(Req 1, 2, 3, 6\)** Finalize and document: MetaMask entry conditions (US, not NY),Confirm mobile \+ browser scope. Define conservative defaults (missing amount → Level 2). Mark all TO BE CONFIRMED items for MetaMask/Transak. Complete Integration with Veriff |
| **Jan 12 \- Jan 16** | **Week 2** | **Identity access \+ Login \+ Account state** | **(Req 4, 5, 9\)** Implement MetaMask-branded email+OTP login.

Define and implement abandoned-KYC behavior (restart from beginning). Design Finalization and handover  |
| **Jan 19 \- Jan 23** | **Week 3** | **KYC Level 1 completion \+ Email/Phone VC issuance** | **(Req 7, 10, 17\)** Implement USA Level 1 capture (name, phone, DOB, SSN, address fields) and SSN+name match check with Veriff (if supported). Issue SD-JWT VC for verified email \+ unverified phone. Implement duplicate identity prevention rules \+ error messaging. |
| **Jan 26- Jan 30** | **Week 4** | **KYC Level 2 \+ Regulated data controls \+ Regulatory Vault** | **(Req 8, 11, 12\)** Implement Level 2 trigger: amount \>$150 OR amount missing. Integrate Veriff doc verification \+ liveness. Enforce accepted docs. Reject if document issuing country mismatch. Issue KYC VC signed on behalf of Veriff by Terminal 3\. Store regulated artifacts (liveness video, passport image, portrait) in Regulatory Vault per jurisdiction rules. Invocation context contract (App ID, env, amount, country), and gating logic.  |
| **Feb 2- Feb 6** | **Week 5** | **Transak verification end-to-end \+ DID registry \+ revocation \+ verifier tooling** | **(Req 13, 14, 15, 16\)** Implement OID4VP request intake from Transak and VP generation (selectively disclose required fields). Confirm VP contents required by Transak. Deliver verification module approach (SDK \+ documentation) enabling Transak to validate signature/issuer/expiry/revocation. Set up DID registry and revocation mechanism linked to issued VCs.  |
| **Feb 9 \- Feb 27** | **Week 6-8** | **Complete Pending flows with Transak \+ E2E testing** | Post alignment with Transak clarify open points and complete scope for first delivery**.**  |

| :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- |
| 1\. | Country Selection on MetaMask Side | On MetaMask side, the users are logged in.  They proceed to select Deposit/Buy button as a new user. if the IP address is pointing to the US, and is not New York, then the users are directed to the Transak Flow  When users is directed to the Transak flow, users are shown the native flow of Terminal 3 KYC MetaMask triggers a notification to Transak to request for VP from us to later verify  | No action on our side |
| 2\.  | MetaMask Invocation Context & Parameters | When MetaMask triggers the Deposit flow, the following context is passed to Terminal 3: MetaMask App ID Environment (Production / Staging) Country selection (from MetaMask) \- we still show country selection screen irrespective Requested transaction type (Deposit) Requested amount (if available) Terminal 3 must not infer country or amount from IP alone if MetaMask provides explicit parameters Light Mode/ Dark mode  Provider Name **Notes** Amount may not always be present (e.g. user enters amount later) If amount is missing, Terminal 3 must conservatively assume **Level 2 KYC** TO BE CONFIRMED: exact parameter contract between MetaMask and Terminal 3 | We are yet to confirm this  |
| 3\. | Environments  | All flows to be implemented on both mobile and browser environments.  |  |
| 4\. | Login (into Terminal 3\)  | Given users want to deposit/buy, When users click the button on MetaMask, Then the users are prompted to login page The login page is MetaMask branded  The only login method here is through e-mail  Once the users enter their email, they are then prompted to enter their OTP  |  |
| 5\. | Account Exists | If account exists, but KYC information missing Then proceed to perform KYC If KYC previously completed  Then proceed to share VP information with Transak |  |
| 6\. | Country of Residence and Document Country selection page | Users are then prompted to enter their country of residence  Users are then prompted to enter the country for document selection  IF residence country \== USA & document\_country \== USA THEN Proceed to KYC IF residence country \!= USA  THEN the user is not allowed to proceed with this flow  IF residence country \== USA & document\_Country \!= USA THEN user can proceed to KYC Transak has its own blacklist accounts list  Transak to provide it  Terminal 3 has to block these and ensure MetaMask does not send the orders in |  |
| 7\. | KYC Level 1 Flow for USA | Details required :  First Name  Last Name Phone Number DOB SSN Address Address Line 1 Address Line 2 State City  Postal/Zip Code Country  Verification Check : To check with Veriff if the SSN and First Name / Last Name match | ![][image1] |
| 8\. | KYC Level 2 Flow for USA | How is amount information passed to T3?  This flow is triggered only when the amount is greater than 150$ OR if  no amount information is received by Terminal 3 As part of Level 2 KYC, we use Veriff’s services to perform  Document Verification Liveness check verification Accepted Documents  National ID Passport Driver’s License  If Passport \!= “ENTERED information” on Step 3, then reject KYC with error “Passport does not match selected country of document issuance”, and redirect users to re-do KYC |  |
| 9 | KYC abandoned  | If KYC is abandoned mid-way by the user, user to start KYC from the beginning   |  |
| 10 | VC for e-mail & phone number | Since the email will be requested in the VP shared with Transak, we require the email to be added to a VC  This VC will contain  The e-mail which is verified  Phone number which is unverified  This VC will be signed by Terminal 3  All VC’s will use SD-JWT format.  |  |
| 11\. | VC for KYC information | Image of Passport Details page Portrait Image  Document Number First Name / Last Name / Name  DOB Date of Expiry  Country of Issuance  Sex Birth Place  Address  Street City Country Postcode  This VC is signed on behalf of Veriff by Terminal 3  |  |
| 12\. | To store in Regulatory Vault | Liveness Check Video Image of the Passport  Portrait Image  |  |
| 13\. | Request for information via OID4VP (from Transak to Terminal 3\) | Transak makes an OID4VP request to Terminal 3 as specified in the specifications [here](https://docs.terminal3.io/api-reference/openid4vp-vc/openid4vp/authorization)  |  |
| 14\. | VP for Verification  | What information is required by Transak Transak needs specific PII for downstream services: First name, last name, mobile number, billing address Document verification \+ liveness check (Level 2 KYC) Income proofs for Level 3 KYC To be confirmed in detail- https://transak.notion.site/On-Ramp-Payment-Methods-Fees-Other-Details-b0761634feed4b338a69f4f186d906a5  |  |
| 15\. | Verification Module  | Provide [documentation](https://docs.terminal3.io/api-reference/vc-sdk/verifier-sdk/verify-presentation) alongside verifier SDK to help the Transak team use this |  |
| 16\. | DID Registry setup & Revocation setup  | Terminal 3 maintains a decentralized identifier (DID) registry that records the active status, issuer, and cryptographic metadata of user identities issued as part of the MetaMask Deposit flow. Each DID is uniquely associated with a Terminal 3 user identity and is used as the root reference for all Verifiable Credentials (VCs) issued for that user. The DID Registry enables verifiers (e.g. Transak) to validate issuer authenticity, credential integrity, and revocation status without accessing underlying Private or Regulated User Data. Terminal 3 supports credential revocation through a cryptographically verifiable revocation mechanism linked to the DID Registry. |  |
| 17\. | Duplicate Identity prevention  | Terminal 3 must prevent: Multiple active KYC identities using the same government ID If duplicate identity detected: User is blocked from creating a new Terminal 3 identity Clear error messaging is shown  |  |
| 18\.  | After KYC Completion | Users must be seamlessly logged in into Transak to perform the transaction.  T3 must handle SSO for Transak (and future providers)  |  |

Meeting Title: Terminal3 and MetaMask KYC integration planning  
Date: Feb 20

Transcript:  
   
Them: Good one to reference as well. Oops.    
Me: Okay?    
Them: Sent the same thing twice. And yeah, I think the abstraction. Layer above. This is around. How much intelligence do we want to put into the Terminal3 3 stack? I could see a world where. Like, let's say the user did five orders with Transact and then they want to get the Metamask card. And for some reason. The way that the card provider evaluates a user's KYC would deny them. We would instead say, like, no, this is a legitimate user. We have these five orders. They should be allowed to get a Metamask card.    
Me: Yeah.    
Them: So that that could be an instance where, like, Terminal3 3 having that user, I don't know, like, order history could be really valuable.    
Me: Valuable. I see it more of a long term thing because I think providers as well, I think within one provider they have the rules of whatever they want to do. But then between providers it's relevant again, like in the longer term, on the kind of activity that the user does. So if they've had like seven successful orders with transact, and then they attempt it with another provider.    
Them: Right.    
Me: Ideally, we want to ensure that this is intended in the way that it is meant to happen instead of it. I think that is also where we see a lot of value. So I'm still thinking, I feel like just relate directly relating this to order is where I think MetaMask can Terminal3 3 can work closely. With this especially cross provider. Given. You all also get the status at the end of the day, right? So we can also use some form. We can also make it at point of invocation, just a little bit of history, like a nuanced history to do the kyc.    
Them: Right. Yeah, that's something that we can maybe pass in on, like. A bulk upload basis for the user versus like having to do it per order.    
Me: Yeah, we can also do it like Async. Yeah. I mean, we can figure out a mechanism. Short term, long term. Cool. Yeah, I think I'll just draft it down and I'll share it. Would you want to run through it before I share it with Transac, or shall I just take a stab at it and share it with them and we can discuss next week?    
Them: Yeah, let's. Let's share with them now. I think. Now, time is of the essence so that we can. We can validate this with them.    
Me: All right. And then we'll have a conversation with them maybe early next week again to kind of get things moving.    
Them: Yes.    
Me: I'll also jot down all the open questions that we have for us to discuss as part of it, to say that these are all things that we need to align on, which will also maybe trigger some questions on their end to kind of iron out by next week with development. I think on our side, we are okay. We might just need to ensure that the end to end of it works. I was just trying to trace back from the date that you were speaking of. Then the other topic that I had was actually go to market on how you're seeing it, essentially. How do you all do rollouts and how perhaps we can also take that into consideration just so I can also plan for scale on our side.    
Them: Yeah, I've done a little bit of thinking there. And been. Planting the seed of calling this, like, a metamask passport and, like, branding it as its own thing. TBD if that's going to stick. There's a few other teams that are trying to brand new products and I think the marketing team is getting a little bit overwhelmed with having a lot of new brands attached. But yeah, in terms of like the general go to market approach, For these type of big announcements, we like to do some kind of, like, PR that announces it with, like, a few reporters, so that that way we get a good amount of press rates and then usually have, like, a blog post that goes live and some, like, social content to try to hit all the different channels. And, yeah, those are, like, the main items, I think, with this one. I don't know if we would want to have the providers involved, so probably would just be like a Terminal3 3 MetaMask.    
Me: Okay, Got it. And in terms of the rollout itself, do you think that we'll be staggering it or essentially, how do you all generally do, or do you plan to do like an AB or do you have any thoughts there before we scale fully?    
Them: My thinking was we would do. We have like, a. Like a staggered release with what the App Store. Takes about, like, a week for us to get to 100%.    
Me: Okay? O.    
Them: And then from there, there's like, an adoption rate of, like, I don't know, 20% per week, like, upgrade. It always takes longer than. Than I anticipate. So I usually expect that a new release takes anywhere from, like, three to five weeks. I get, like, full adoption.    
Me: Kay. Okay? Okay?    
Them: So because of that, I don't think we should try to limit the rollout, and we should have it be available to all new users. Is how I was thinking about it.    
Me: Okay. I think in that case, we should try to release. I'm just trying to backtrack. Right. Essentially, I think we should try to release. I would want to aim for end of March or April, first week after, and test, ensure that we've tested end to end, at least, like pilot it out then to ensure that the end to end test is kind of completed by then. I do think the effort on transact side is little and from Metamask primarily we just need the invocation and implementation. I think that is where there might be some time that we might require. So let me know what you need for me to unblock your team, because on our side, we are trying to wind up. We were just waiting for the agreement, essentially. I think once that's done, we want. I just want to be. I want to ensure that engineering teams can just set things off. And I'm not sure would you know where the business sides are. Business side is on.    
Them: Yeah, I do have an update there. Don't want to bury the lead at the end of the call. So a couple things came up over the last week. One is our like leadership wanted to see more of a comparison of other solutions. So we're doing, like, a quick due diligence on IDOs. I'm not sure if you're familiar with them. Okay? Yeah. Yeah, we've got some feedback that it. It's not a good look if we just have, like, one option, especially because the Terminal3 3\. Cost have the like platform fee? So trying to explain, like, where, where the value of that comes in versus, like, just having the, like, standard KYC cost is like, an open question. So, yeah, that's. That's, like, one item. On our end that we've already started and, like, met with. So if you have anything in terms of, like, a direct comparison, there. I think that that could be helpful. Like, we'll still need to go through the motions of getting something from them. That, then we can put side by side and say, like, here's why we still want to go with Terminal3 3\. But, yeah, if you have any talking points, that would be helpful.    
Me: Yeah, I can definitely get you those across. I feel like business team has a better way to probably phrase this out then I do. I do have a comparison sheet but more from a product standpoint and I think I will, I will ensure that the sales team kind of gets into the I will give them my points on on why our products better and they can massage it to ensure that it's better for I guess business to business communications. But but yes, Anu, happy to push through those points. I don't want to comment on it before reviewing it. It's been a while since I've checked on the competitive analysis sheet, but yes. Okay, got it. I think that is valuable for me to know. Cool. But do you anticipate any kind of timelines here?    
Them: I don't have, like, a specific date, but I feel like this is something we want to close out before the end of the month. Especially knowing that we have, you know, the, like, April date that we would like to go live.    
Me: Yeah.    
Them: And my engineering resources are about to open up pretty soon, so want to make sure we have, like, the PRDs and the designs ready to go so that we don't have that dreaded, you know, engineers twittering their thumbs.    
Me: Yeah. Yeah. I would also expect the engineer, engineers, engineering leads, to have a conversation before I guess we also kick things off right now. I've kind of jotted everything down, so I'll pass that over to you today and we'll take it from there.    
Them: Yeah. And then the other item that that came up didn't want us to bring this on you. What? You guys were away on Chinese New Year? One of the other. Zero knowledge providers just in the sake of transparency and getting through it pretty quickly. Zkme Are you familiar with them?    
Me: I'm not, but the ZK team probably is, but, yeah.    
Them: Yeah, we were. One of our other teams was. Was chatting with them and they mentioned we were going with Terminal3 3\. And they shared some claims about some potential, like, legal dispute between ZKME and Terminal3 3\. We weren't able to, like, find anything specifically on that. I'd like send you an email with these. Things, but wanted to give you, like, a heads up before it came in. The one that I think would be helpful to quickly talk through is they pointed out that humanity protocol. Had 88% of their identities flagged as bots. There was some, like marketing or not marketing. Some presser that happened last year with the CEO where he said that 88% of the identities on the human ID network. Were bots. And I know that's, like, one of the companies that are listed on the Terminal3 3 website.    
Me: We do work with Humanity Protocol, but I don't think this claim is true. In fact, the founders are friends. You know, Humanity Protocol. And Gary and Malcolm, they're all friends, so I do not see this as true. At least not to the best of my knowledge. I will definitely get the legal team on this, but. At least from the product standpoint. None of this is of knowledge to me, right. Like this is the first time I'm hearing about it. This would have at least been spoken about in the time that I was here, but I did not, and I am not aware of any legal disputes that are ongoing. I mean, the company would be very busy if that were true. So I. I don't want to, you know, acknowledge, or I acknowledge that I've heard this, but I don't want to agree or disagree. I think it's better for the legal team to take this up, but to the best of my knowledge, at least, for transferrs with transparency between you and me, none of this is to my attention and anything that the company is dealing with right now. Right. And that, I mean, you can keep that as my word to you. Just from a product standpoint, none of this has really occurred as a problem or anything that I've dealt. With anyway, so let me definitely let Joey know about this and Zkme. We've probably done a competitive analysis, but I've never heard of any legal disputes that's ongoing. So I will definitely put this into the relevant years for them to ensure that we can provide substantial information in the direction that metamask would need to ensure that things can go through as we expect them to.    
Them: Cool. Yeah. No. I started looking at some of the claims, and I think they seem to misrepresent quite a few. Quite a few things. So. So, yeah, it's not something that I'm, like, super concerned with, but I do want to have, like, something to show of. Like, we, like, looked into this and, you know, this is why we're still confident in Terminal3 3\. So I would, like send you an email with those claims, and then if you can get the right folks, that'd be really helpful.    
Me: Absolutely. No, absolutely. I would appreciate if you could also c. Malcolm into it. I would also keep him aware, especially because I think they're all friends. I think within the industry. Both Gary and Malcolm have a lot of friends, especially in the Web3 community because of just being part of Web3 harbor for a very long time. And this would have definitely come up in one way or the other if it were true. So I will definitely ensure that, you know, I think Malcolm would be the right person, especially given he has the full history and he might directly be able to answer some of these. If not, we definitely involve legal to ensure that they give the right answers as well. But that said, the. The claims feel random, if I might say so. But, yeah, I think that's off the books. Just my opinion.    
Them: Okay? Y. Eah. I mean, it's kind of a small industry and very competitive, so.    
Me: Conflict, apparently. Yeah, I didn't. I didn't think it was this ruthless, but interesting to note that as well.    
Them: I guess bear market vibes.    
Me: Yeah. No, but thank you so much for sharing that, Lorenzo. I feel like it's. It's good for me to hear it as well. I wouldn't want the deal to break through because of something not substantiated, so I think that really helps. So we can help at least squash it out or nip. It in the bud as it comes along.    
Them: Sounds like a plan.    
Me: Excellent.    
Them: Cool. Yeah, I think we can call it there. Nice to have you back and talk soon.    
Me: Yeah, Talk soon. And I will share. I think there's one more architecture diagram that I owe you which is also ready. Again, there were some missing pieces that. That we discussed today that I just wanted to iron out. I will share it with you based on some assumptions, but feel free to, you know, it's. Again. Like a discussion platform as I want to view it and not a final diagram. So feel free to let me know if you feel like, okay, this is not something that you can work out or it would be better than a different direction. But I think that should hopefully help pace things up for us next week. For us also like, change the way we're building things should be. Have to.    
Them: Sounds like a plan.    
Me: Excellent.    
Them: Thank you.    
Me: Thank you. Thank you so much. All right.    
Them: Have a great day. Talk soon. 

Meeting Title: KYC Product Sync | MetaMask \<\> Terminal 3  
Date: Feb 20  
Meeting participants: Lorenzo Santos, Malcolm Ong

Transcript:  
   
Me: Hello.    
Them: Hello. Good morning.    
Me: Can you see me?    
Them: No, it seems like the video still off.    
Me: Oh, it's disabled for me. I don't know why it's disabled for me. Okay? Maybe. Can I just join back maybe?    
Them: Sure.    
Me: Let me join. But. Sorry, just give me a moment.    
Them: No worries.    
Me: All right, I don't know what's wrong with the video, so you might have to just stick with my audio for the day.    
Them: No worries. Yeah, usually. Is it disabled? Like in the bottom left corner?    
Me: Yeah, I disabled. I'm not sure ado it was all right when I just joined the call now it's just disabled like I can't click the button.    
Them: Let me see this.    
Me: Oh, yeah, that worked. I mean, I clicked start my video.    
Them: All right? Yeah. No worries. I could go off video too, I guess.    
Me: I'm so sorry about that. I'll sort this out. I'm not sure what's wrong with my zoom today.    
Them: I feel like whenever. We do, like New Year's break. I come back and something breaks. Like I'm locked out of systems or I forget my computer password.    
Me: Yeah. I really don't know what's up with it. Okay, I'll check it out later. But, yeah, I think just bear with my voice for the day, I guess. First off, I wanted to start off with an apology. There was a bit of a coordination issue on my side and I think I became a bit of a blocker. So before I went on my holiday, I told the team to actually provide the doc to transact, but they got stuck on a point and they weren't sure if the conversation we had so seem unprepared and I'll go over the point today, I think it might be important for us to discuss as well. But yeah, they didn't want to seem unprepared or ignorant. So as a consequence, which they were waiting for me and I did not have Internet. And so then I came to know yesterday that we did not, in fact, pass the doc. So I am going to ensure that that's out by today. And now that I'm back, I'll ensure that we are back on pace. But, yeah, my sincere apologies for that. I think that was fully on me. It was a bit of a coordination issue that was on me.    
Them: Okay?    
Me: But, yeah, we'll be back on pace starting today.    
Them: Yeah. Appreciate you. You saying that. Yeah. I noticed there wasn't any action on the channel. And for a second I thought there was an action item on my end. But, yeah, we actually ended up having a fraud incident the last couple days. Might have not been able to make a ton of progress regardless.    
Me: I see. I see. But I think now that I hope the incident was okay with mitigatable.    
Them: For the most part. It's actually an interesting one that we should talk about with Transact. It was a sophisticated fraud vector using our white label ramps. And targeting. Let me open up the doc. It was targeting Wells Fargo bins. And they worry about it through some of the KYC processes as well.    
Me: Oh, my God.    
Them: Yeah, I have been kind of like a full technical breakdown on how they were able to get through it. When I asked yesterday, they said it was too early to start pointing fingers. But for me, this is like the second time on Fido. Is involved in some kind of compromise.    
Me: Oh, no. Okay, I see. Okay. Yeah. Do let me know before the details as well. So I think we can also ensure we have some precautionary measures there. Feel like learn a little bit more about the loophole here, but if you're seeing it is on Fido. I think that's also a good point. For us to learn from as we move forward, so. Oh, interesting. But I really hope it started now and you were able to. Are we able to prevent it from noticing a pattern?    
Them: It seems like there's. Yeah, there's some things that they've done, like blocking Wells Fargo linked cards and then they re enabled 3ds. For all us cards. And then disabled the simple KYC in the us. So a lot of the optimizations we made to let more users in have been hardened now. Yeah, the part I don't have full context on is, like, how were the stolen identities? Usable. Within the system, so.    
Me: Interesting.    
Them: What checks was on Fido doing that was missed and then also their risk engine.    
Me: Yeah, interesting. But thanks for sharing that. I will definitely take it back to the team as well and see if I would love to understand a little bit more and dig a bit deeper on this as well. On why on FIDO is able to get through and the other providers, Verif and such have some triggers in place for this. I mean, the whole point of KYC is to ensure there's no identity theft and no duplication of kyc. So I'm quite appalled at it. But yeah, thanks for sharing that. On our agenda. I actually had a bunch of items and there are a bunch of things I owe you as well, and the doc's almost ready for me to share it with UN Transact. So I think before you wake up, or before Transact really wakes up, I should be able to share it with them today. It's basically going to be an end to end integration, Doc. But there was one critical open point which is also what stall the team. And I also thought it's better for us to align on before it raises. I did see that transact had some hesitations towards doing kyc, so I just wanted to ensure that we are fully aligned before we share anything. I think we can help use this call for that.    
Them: Right. Let's do it. There. There is one point I wanted to cover as well, but. Yeah, let's clear through this. Blocker.    
Me: Sure, sure. So I'll just walk through. Okay. I can't share. Okay, it's fine. I think I'll just quickly go over it orally. Right. So right now the invocation flow is when Metamask passes us a bunch of details. I've put that down. Essentially, we need a it. Can be from, like, from the front end. I still think this should be okay, but if you have a back end, it's probably better. But irrespective, I think a bunch of information on the amount, especially the amount I think that really is directly related to the KYC flow. But aside from that, there are a bunch of other details that I'd shared, which will be as part of the doc. Now KYC is completed and transacted request for name, date of birth and email, if not any of the other details and it's sent to them to say level 1 or X level based on the amount is passed, so based on amount based calculations. So once the order completes on transact site, this is where I think I needed a bit of help. We need to know if it's successful. So my first question to you is, how do they notify to you?    
Them: Currently, we do polling from the user's device. I think it's every 10 seconds. We submit a request for the order status.    
Me: Okay. Okay. Got it. And it's meant to be a synchronous order.    
Them: Correct. The user can only have one order at a time.    
Me: Okay? Okay, got it. I think the best is maybe once you get the polling status. And if the order is success, at what point does the order stay open? And how long does it stay open if there is no response on the order status? Do you have, like, a limitation on that?    
Them: Yeah, There's a specific schedule. That is based on the order type. That would be a good question for transact to answer. I'm sure they have this in their doc somewhere, but yeah, generally a bank transfer will stay open in terms of days.    
Me: I see.    
Them: But then, like a card, transaction will settle pretty quickly into failed or successful.    
Me: I see. Okay, got it. The reason I'm asking this is this directly affects the next kyc. Because essentially, what I was thinking is, after Metamask gets notified, perhaps you can tell us when an order is successful, as a consequence of which T3 will then store the provider the amount transacted thus far. For the MetaMask ID, the type of transaction, and KYC status trigger. But what I'm realizing is you need one more pillar there, which is the method of payment, because that also determines okay, yeah, I think that complicates the logic a bit. If it's going to be two days, but let me discuss that with the engineer. Yeah, so far.    
Them: Great. Oh, no. Sorry. Go for it.    
Me: Yeah. No, so far I was thinking it's mainly the provider, the amount, the type of transaction and the KYC status to trigger the next KYC or share what's required with, transact or to proceed with a transaction. But if it's also the method of payment, for example. If a bank, say if they've triggered a bank transaction, which happens to be the one that's open for the longest, and they try to trigger another one before that transaction closes, is that possible?    
Them: I don't think so.    
Me: No. Okay. Okay. I think that would. That would be better.    
Them: Yeah, because on the front end, if we see that there's an order open. Yeah, we wouldn't allow for another one to go through.    
Me: Got it. So in some way, we will have to ensure we maintain the order status. I think the alternative is for Metamask to give the summation. Do you all maintain a record of it? I don't think so. Right, because.    
Them: Not currently. Yeah. I think currently. We are doing. The polling. So we have, like, order id. With the status and then we pull for that. I guess we can build in logic that when we do that polling, the response gets updated locally and then also sends a Terminal3 3 if it matches a failed like. Like a Terminal3 status.    
Me: Yeah, got it. Okay. Yeah, it makes sense. I think that will be required. And the second is un transact use order ID as the common id. Is that correct? Or do you also have a user identifier?    
Them: For the white label integration. I believe there's a user auth token that is. Yeah, that's authenticating all the calls.    
Me: Okay? Okay. The one thing that will be critical for us to implement and might be the one that transact might push back, which is what I was like, I was just sitting on this for a very long time to see what else we can do would be the MetaMask ID that we are planning for that, that identifier. Needs to be present in this order status that you sent to us and also in what we will trigger to transact so something for them to accept as an identifier. Perhaps if they already have an identifier today, they can use that as a reference. And anyway they might have to implement this webhook from scratch, so it should be ok. But internally they have to ensure that they have they create some form of mapping between MetaMask ID to the current reference. So aside from verification, this is one additional piece of work that they will have to do. I was just trying to see if this can be simplified, but this MetaMask ID being part of all the transactions and becoming the main identifier, or at least one of the identifiers in the transaction will be crucial.    
Them: Yeah, I'm wondering. Like if we take a step back. From this. Are we adding more of this? Context in Terminal3 3\. So that. Terminal3 3 knows when, like more. KYC is needed or to be able to have, like, a better risk view of the user.    
Me: Yes. So when you say more risk, what other attributes do you mean? I mean there were a few that we discussed, but like our risk engines haven't as in whatever risk engines we have today are aligned with whatever KYC in general that we do not additional transaction based risk. Like we don't do as much Kyt today. Even though that's the longer term plan.    
Them: Yeah. Because I'm. I'm wondering if, like you, if. If you're not taking into account. The. The like order to develop, like some kind of risk or on the user, then do we need, at least in the first version, do we need to have that signal going back to Terminal3 3? Or do we just have it wherein if Transact says like, oh, this is the third time the user is doing an order, we need to do more kyc then they say to us. Hey, trigger standard KYC2. And then we go to Terminal3 3 and say, like, do the step up now.    
Me: Right. So the way that we've kind of or internally what's being built right now is based off of the doc that you share of Transact, which involves the amount and essentially the currency. Remember, there was dog that shared, so we are mimicking that. So we care for the provider. So if it is transact. We care for the amount that's being triggered.    
Them: Yes.    
Me: We consume the accumulation of amount, which is why we need to know whether an order was successful and when it was triggered to understand how much is allowed. Right. Like so, if it is under 150, then, for example, there's only the user input. But then if a user is doing if it's a max. Cap, then we ensure that it goes to level two. We also see the type of transaction of course for transact is just directly going to be on ramp, right? Like just a fear to crypto. But we are still taking that method like that variable because I do think as we increase to providers type of transaction will matter. And lastly, they're currently done KYC status, which is how often was it successful in the first attempt, so on and so forth. So those are the four parameters we care for. But if there are any other risk considerations that are crucial, we are happy to also do the computation as such for transact. Do suppose that.    
Them: Yeah, I guess what I'm saying is on the first transaction, that makes sense. Or like, just to get the user initially onboarded. But in terms of like the. Like the order succeeding or not. That shouldn't really need Terminal3 3\. Unless transact needs to do more kyc.    
Me: The reason I will need the order success is because if, say, a user has done 150 on a particular day. And they try 150 again. Now, if the first 150 has failed, they should be allowed to do 150 in the second attempt with the Level 1 KYC, right? That is the odd. For that matter, there were more, I guess, nuances into it. So in terms of amounts especially and currency especially, wherein if it is a specific amount, then it goes to Level two. Like it's accumulation when we go to Level two or Level three, rather. Rather than it being. Or are you saying that just based on attempt, Just. Just, you know, even if, irrespective of whether it's passed or failed, we just ask for level 2 KYC the second time.    
Them: No, I'm seeing more of, like, on the first session. I agree that Terminal3 3 should have that. Routing logic figured out, like level one, level two, but on the, like, subsequent transactions, like, once the user is onboarded and they're like,    
Me: With.    
Them: Yeah. Then that's when we just refer to transact. And then they say, like, now we need to do more for the user.    
Me: Correct.    
Them: For this specific user.    
Me: So you mean after level 1, 2, 3, KYC is done? Like until proof of address. Then after that, yeah, we just. We pass it on to transact. That is accurate as of today. We do not track after that. But you're suggesting that Transact will then come back. But we. They've already finished proof of address. What do you expect Transact to do today? What do they do today after proof of address has also been completed?    
Them: Yeah, let me. Just start to think about, like, how this scales up. If we, as we add, like, different payment methods, that. Trigger different types of. Like, for example, we're, we're going to do ACH bank transfers in the US that one's going to need a level 2, regardless of the amount. I found figma. So currently, what we do is. We have this, like, user details fetched. Actually, let me take a step back. So we have. The user come in, they put in an amount, and then we check if they're logged in. And if they are logged in, then we fetch for user details. That tells us what the status is of the user's current KYC if it's not submitted. And then there's this additional forms required. That's what triggers the Level 2\.    
Me: Yeah.    
Them: And essentially like this user details call happens like pretty much every time the user comes in. But if transact says this users approved, then they just go straight through and we don't have to do any of the kyc. So what I'm saying is if the user comes in the first time.    
Me: Yeah.    
Them: They do the kyc and then they come in the second time, and the order they're doing doesn't trigger, like, an Additional Level 2\.    
Me: Yeah.    
Them: Then we wouldn't have to tell Terminal3 3 about that order at all.    
Me: Yeah, yeah, that. That's fair. Yeah, that's fair. As long as, like, I mean, I think, like you rightly pointed out, for us, it's only relevant when they need to do addition kyc, especially after a juncture where I believe they fully finish onboarding. Right. I think if you, if they finish level 1, 2, 3 KYC. After that, if they still need additional requirements or there needs to be re KYC, I think that's when Terminal3 3 might be relevant. But I would like to understand the scenarios where this would happen after a long break and like what values will be considered when that DKYC is performed. It might not be fully relevant, at least for the mvp, but I still feel like it's good for us to just have it discussed, I suppose, just to ensure that I can ensure, like, at least the architecture is in place when in future, when Transact requests further information. Then we're able to kind of grow into it. And have those conditions saved.    
Them: Yeah, no, I definitely agree that Terminal3 3 should have a holistic view of the user and then be able to account for all of the forms that would be needed. I'm just thinking, if we can, Descope does part of having Terminal3 3 do the full assessment of how much has this user spent? Because the other thing could be is like what if the user reverses an order? So now you have three completed orders on your end, but Transact only has two on their side. So now you might.    
Me: Yeah. Yeah. That's. The star is management might be like, you know, the status differs between the three of us. Then it is a problem. that is true i was thinking about this a lot i think this was actually the

Date: Feb 20

Transcript:  
   
Them: Hey, morning, jan.    
Me: Hey. Hi. I think Amit is also online, so maybe we can also add him to the call.    
Them: Okay, let me figure out how to do this. People. On. It.    
Me: Yeah, same. Oh, he's. Yeah. Okay.    
Them: Good.    
Me: I was just saying why? Well, happy new year.    
Them: Yeah. Happy seeing why. It was good. A lot of family and friends and babies.    
Me: Very nice. Why are you in hong kong?    
Them: Yeah. I just stayed in hong kong. Wouldn't say it was the most restful and chillax just because of all these obligations that it is what it is.    
Me: I can imagine. Okay.    
Them: What about you?    
Me: I was in Jojakarta and I was up the mountains, so that was not as much Internet.    
Them: Nice.    
Me: So I think it forced me to disconnect in ways. I think that's a good thing.    
Them: Yeah. That's good.    
Me: No, but I fell sick, though. Was a rather slow vacation. I think it was a forced break for me. Honestly, in a lot of ways, I think life just was like, please slow down. Very forcibly so. But no, it's good on the whole.    
Them: Gotcha.    
Me: It's probably so Raleigh for him.    
Them: Yeah, it's probably super early.    
Me: Okay? It's fine.    
Them: All right. Malcolm is also going to join. Give me a sec. Let me un Malcolm.    
Me: Okay?    
Them: Hey, amit.    
Me: I'm here as well.    
Them: Give us a second. We're also getting Malcolm to join.    
Me: Amit said that it's super early for him, so.    
Them: I'll have to just go out and take a call in the balcony as everybody's sleeping in the house, so give me just two seconds before I start speaking.    
Me: No, he's doing.    
Them: Yeah, of course. Sorry for making you join so early.    
Me: Oh. He?    
Them: I'll just log out of here and join from my laptop. Now. Okay, no problem.    
Me: Oh, Amit is asking to be invited again. How did you add him in?    
Them: Well, let me do it. In my people.    
Me: Did Malcolm say you'll join?    
Them: Yeah. He pinged me on WhatsApp and said he would join.    
Me: Okay?    
Them: All right, I've gotten Gary as well on this.    
Me: Okay?    
Them: Maybe this invite function isn't good because they're not seeing anything.    
Me: Yeah.    
Them: Weird.    
Me: Should we get off and then do a huddle with Ama join, though?    
Them: Okay, let me just create a new group with five of us. And let me try that. Is it better if we do a Google Meet and send an invite out to everybody? Just a link on WhatsApp.    
Me: Yeah, listen to Google Meet and then.    
Them: Okay?    
Me: I'll drop off from here.    
Them: All right.    
Me: Okay? Should we put the Google needs. URL. On.    
Them: Let me dm everybody. So can I get in touch with an outcome?    
Me: Should we maybe get started and then I can film Malcolm and later?    
Them: Okay. Yeah, let's do that. Hey, guys. So let's take the step by step. So let's start with the message. Where did the message come? Who is the message from and give us the specifics of the message point by point.    
Me: So I had my weekly sync with Metamask today, this morning, between 8:30aM and 9:30 MST, which is actually there 7 to 8pm and this call is on a weekly basis with their product manager, Lorenzo. So it's just between Lorenzo and me. So we were the only ones in the call. The call actually started off with product discussions, so there was some open points that we closed out on. We hadn't closed out on Last Call with regards to the end to end flow. And that's how it started, in which he said that he did not get a lot done last week because there was a P0 incident on Metamar side for KYC fraud with Transac and likely triggered and right now they are still doing post mortem but it's mostly because of on Feedo. My guess this is what triggered a lot.    
Them: Go back. Slow down. Go through the trigger again. What happened? What do you know about the incident? And why do you consider this to be a.    
Me: Of details were shared, but he said that there's postmortem ongoing. There was KYC fraud with their transactions with Transac today. And Onfeedo does the kyc. So it's likely because of kyc. And that is what Lorenzo feels. But the internal discussions right now say that let's not start pointing fingers. As a consequence of this KYC fraud, all transactions through Transact has to go through level 2 KYC based on new regulations, which has caused a drop in conversion. Which is what Lorenzo was leadership got involved and Lorinzo said that he was very preoccupied with this. He shared this as a general note. During the call to say that he's not really been able to focus on a lot of architecture open questions that we had. This is my conclusion that this triggered internal conversations because they probably needed to speed up their KYC solution internally. This is how started.    
Them: Okay? Okay, continue.    
Me: A lot of productive architecture discussion. Post that. And then once we've concluded, he said he had a couple of things more to raise that came up in the last week, and he did not disturb the team or me because of cny. So the first one being. The fact that leadership said that they wanted to do more competitive analysis beyond Terminal3 3\. And he just said that he wanted to be transparent with me. And the reason that he wants to also do this is because we are charging a specific platform fee. This terminology came up, and they just wanted to ensure that we are valuable. So as a consequence of which they are looking at idos. I'll just take a pause there.    
Them: To be competitive. Analysis between us and idos, specifically.    
Me: Doing a few different. They're doing competitive analysis to see who else is there in the market. And specifically, they are in conversation with idos. That's pretty much only one of the ones that at least he mentioned out loud.    
Them: Okay. And then the trigger point for the competitive analysis is because we are charging a platform fee. Okay? Id. Okay, so let's pause here, and let's talk about what we know about IDOs. I actually don't know much about IDOs, but my understanding is that IDO has its full self custody. Identity. Is that correct? What do we know about idos?    
Me: I will have to research. I do not have knowledge here as such right off the bat.    
Them: Anyone else on this call know anything about idos? I just know that they're started by a consortium, but I'm still doing more research as well. Okay? All right. I was looking at it before we jumped on the call. It is not centralized custody, it's self custody. That's what it says on the website. Yeah, that's what I said. Obviously, what is said on the website and what they actually have, it could be two very different things. They might be presenting themselves as self custody. But they actually aren't. Anyway. Okay, so, Idos, we also need to do more research on. So he brought up the fact that there is competitive analysis going on because of the fact that we are charging a platform for you or that we intend on charging a platform fee post 18 months. Okay, great. So that's point number two. Next.    
Me: So when he spoke about IDOs, he said that he wanted to transparently share this with us, because he said that if I or sales team has any point of view or pointers on why we think we are better, then Lorenzo said that he's happy to be the spokesperson. Spokesperson who transfers that message through, so. He asked me for any bullets. I said that we will take this back and ensure that we provide you with substantial points based off of the analysis that we've done.    
Them: Okay, next.    
Me: The second pointer came up, which was fuzzy. He's like. We were also speaking to Zkme. And the second point has actually stirred up some emotions internally with the legal teams because Zkme apparently went on to say that there is a legal dispute that's there between us and them. And I said I was aware of no such thing, but I will let the correct team speak with you. And they also made claims that humanity protocol. There was an issue where 88% of the identities were flagged as bots. And which is why the dispute is in order. And Metamask tried to go online. And search and there was no such evidence. But then they saw that Humanity Protocol is listed on our website, so he thought he will check with me. I said I am aware of no such thing, but I said the best person to speak about this would be the legal team. So I will ensure that the correct people respond to this accurately.    
Them: Okay. And do you have more information about. You said. You're suggesting that Lorenzo's language is. That it stirred up emotions in the leadership team. Is that his language? And if it was, is there any more color around this?    
Me: He said it stirred up emotions within the team. He did not say leadership team and that is his word. Those are his. That's quote unquote what he said. He did not share anything further. He said he will drop me an email. I asked him to CC Malcolm in it as well and then he said that. I could then respond to that email. He just shared this towards the end of the call, but he did not shed anything more on this. He just asked if it's true. And then I said. I said I'm not aware of any such thing. And the only thing I said was, I'm aware that hv's founders and other founders of Terminal3 3 are very good friends, in fact, and this potentially is competitive misinformation. And he seemed to laugh and agree, and he's like, it's possible that they're doing this for competitive claims. He seemed to agree over there, but he ended in a lighter note, he didn't treat it as basically where the conversation ended, actually.    
Them: Okay? So give us then, your best sense after this conversation, what the state of this potential partnership and deal is now. Where is Lorenzo's head at? Are we still in the leading position competitively, or are we now trying to claw our way back or potentially even completely out of the running based on what he was, what he communicated to.    
Me: Just based on the earlier conversation with which how we started. Basically we went into deep diagnosis of the end to end architecture and how to move things forward from an engineering standpoint. We also spoke of dates. He did say that he wanted to go live by March 31 so that they can test for two weeks and then they can actually roll out on April 15 and 16\. These were all aspects from a product standpoint that he discussed. So I still do think that he likes working with the overall team and he senses that there is value here. But if we are somehow unable to come out of these allegations, which I believe is more on the commercial side of things. If we are able to sort that through, we will still be able to get through. But if the legal dispute, and if there is any such thing that's true, then it might stir up the waters, is what I think.    
Them: Okay, awesome. Anything else that you want to add as context before I start addressing each of these points?    
Me: This is mainly what was shared. I don't think I'm missing out on anything. I think I've tried to cover as much in detail.    
Them: Okay, cool. Jan, thank you so much. I appreciate this. Just as an FYI, we got a very cryptic note from our consensus investor at this point, probably about 36 hours ago, that suggested that I wouldn't call it reconsideration, but there was some consideration ongoing. And very specifically, it sounds like it's probably the ZK meeting. They probably reached out to our investor to be like, hey, is it illegal Dispute going on with Zkme doesn't know much and he works directly for Joe Lubin, who's the founder of Consensus. And so he said, let me go dig further, and then I'll get back to you. I just pinged him and asked if we could jump on a call really quickly just to see what else he found, to give us a little bit more context. Okay, so let's address the points one by one. First of all, it sounds like there are three triggers. The first trigger is our fault. The first trigger is the fact that in our discussions about pricing throughout the last several months, we had not properly brought up the platform fee. The fact that we sell our product as SaaS and eventually did bring it up only about two weeks ago, and a pricing document that caught them off guard. That probably left a bad taste in their mouths. This is something that Amit, Joan, myself and Charmaine dealt with about two weeks back and I think we got to a decent resolution with Alex, their business lead. But my guess is that it changes the calculus on their side, which is what has reopened up the competitive analysis for pricing in particular. This is a hard lesson learned for us, but we have to acknowledge that the first trigger is our fault. The second trigger sounds like is the KYC fraud issue with On Fido. I mean, I don't know if at some point we will be able to get a little bit more detail from Lorenzo about it. If it is KYC fraud, it certainly feels like that would be an On Fido issue. It's something that we cannot be immune to because we use third parties for kyc. At the end of the day, if we use verific KYC for this, we're going to have to rely on verification, getting KYC right and not being defrauded by bad actors on their side. Just as long as we're generally upfront about all of this, but that's a second trigger that was not our doing. But clearly shows a sensitivity on their side that KYC fraud is of great concern. So that means our choice of vendor is even more important now. And then the third trigger would be the Zkme thing. Let me just be up front very clear. There is no ongoing anything with zkaming. So Jan and Amit, you guys may not know ZK me well. They are another Hong Kong based company that has been an absolute agitator and a thorn in our side from the very beginning. Their founders of Young German Guy who moved to Hong Kong a few years ago, and his little personality online is to be an agitator. He goes after whomever he wants for attention, hates the fact that he's not as important as he thinks he ought to be, and. He's like the worst of the worst in our industry. And we made a choice a year ago, wouldn't you say? I think, Joan Malcolm, to just not to stop engaging. Originally, we were trying to invite him into the fold. I even went out of my way to actually meet with them several times in person. The asking, you know, to get to know him, to talk about collaboration because it's a small industry, and to share notes on regulatory compliance. And those conversations just turn to him throwing insane. Accusations at us. And so as a company, we decided about a year ago to completely disengage. We don't respond to his messages anymore. We don't respond to irritants posts that he makes, or comments that he makes on our LinkedIn posts, as he almost always does when we when we announce something. And actually, unfortunately, and this is a negative result of this, It's actually made Lauren much less willing to post things about our business deals and whatnot. On LinkedIn because she doesn't want to deal with Alex's inevitable comments. But we do not have. Any kind of legal dispute with them. We do not have any working and business. We've never had any working or business relationship with them. There is no personal relationship to speak of here. So that is absolutely 100% true. I just want to. I just want to make sure again with you that there's. There's nothing ongoing. There's never been Wizikami 100%. There's never formal communications, nothing. Yeah. Great. And there's literally zero surface for potential conflict. We did not share any partners. The only complication here. The only complication here is actually that. And again, I'm just being overly transparent. But Jan and Ahmed, just to be clear, this last point I'm about to make. Should never be communicated to Metamask. Okay? And I'll explain exactly why. Okay? Because it actually throws other people under the bus, not us. The only, you know, I guess, overlap with ZKME is that a year and a half ago we were in deep conversations with Mochaverse, and originally we were supposed to be the identity provider for MOCA with Animoca, and then there ended up being a conflict of philosophy. Between us and the Moco team. So we left that relationship alone, that we didn't do anything with them. And MOCA has now chosen Zkme as their identity layer. But more importantly, Animoca has put in an investment into Zkme, which has an option for acquisition. So effect effectively you can think about Zkme as now an Animoca Animoca company. They're almost fully controlled now by Animoca, the vast majority of their engineering workers for Animoca and Mochaverse. And in fact, MOCA is about to launch their mainnet, and the mainnet is actually what originally was known as MeChain. It's CK, Me's blockchain. So that was the only potential overlap of potential partner, which it never came into fruit. However. However, here's the thing. Here's the fly in the ointment. Is that actually, Zeke me did steal Rip or Mocha did one or the other, and we are quite sure of that. We shared internal technical documentation, early technical documentation, like, from, like, a year and a half ago. So it's not even that critical or important to us anymore. We shared it. With Mochaverse at one point, because we were literally in deep discussions about becoming the identity layer from Mocha. And we found out afterwards from both an industry friend, but also from the actual executive who leads Mocha, that that document ended up in the architecture. Of moca's id stack. Which now Zkme kind of controls. And so we know. We know that they have taken at least some part of our IP that we shared and privilege with a partner that we thought was a lock. To use us. That, again, was us being naive and idealistic early on in our commercialization. We've learned from that lesson. That's why we're much more careful about NDAs and also sharing technical documentation at this point. So had there ever been a legal dispute? It would have been us actually suing Animoca and Dazikeme for IP violation. We have never taken even half a step towards that because we realize that at the end of the day, that would be like, you know, there's no. There's no use fighting in the mud here, so we never did it. We never even made a move to do it. But I'm sure. My guess is that Alex has a sensitivity to this because he knows that he and his partner, Kenneth, who's the mocha guy. Did something wrong in all of this. Okay, so that's just context for Jan and Amit. So he is an unbeliev. He's a, like, an absolute and ridiculous annoyance. Has always been. And this is. This is absolute nonsense. That's the third trigger. That's the trigger. That is really, really important. For us to clarify with the consensus team. Now, there are two approaches to clarifying. I'll get to the other two points in a minute. But on this one, I think we can do this relatively quickly. Jan, do you have a very friendly tech space relationship with Lorenzo? Okay? After this call. I want you to. Let's. Let's wordsmith a very short response. For you to send to Lorenzo on text to clarify with them that there is absolutely no legal dispute going on with Dkme. That there's. There's never been any legal dispute or commercial relationship or even partner overlap with the kme. Zkme is just a known irritant in the industry. We have to wordsmith that really carefully. I'm not going to use the word urgent, but I want. I need. We need to communicate to Lorenzo that we are not surprised that the founders are not surprised by this. Because Zkme, you know, this is. This is a. This is. They. They make a habit of competitive misuse. Use his language that he's already offered up to us. Because it really is what they do, right? So I will work with you on slack to do a very short message. And send to them. On the zkme issue. Now on humanity protocol. Zkme and humanity protocol also do not get along. Zkme has been going after Commandeer Protocol for quite some time because they hate the idea. Well, first of all, Alex hates Terrence. But Alex Scheer, who's the founder of Zkmean, hates the idea that Humanity Protocol, you know, two years after Zkme had been founded, Came out and announced this. This thing that ZKME themselves have been building towards with Terminal3 3 help because we were their identity layer for 18 months. And immediately was able to teach and at one point got to a 3 billion dollar FTV. It drives Alex nuts. He's made it very clear in the industry how much he dislikes Terrence, how much he does not trust humanity. He has, in private messages gone after Terrence quite a number of times. To Terrence's credit, he's ignored all of this, so we know that Zkme absolutely has a bone to pick. With humanity protocol. And Alex has said this much to Ananoka, which is really dumb because Animoca is an investor and a huge investor. Humanity protocol. Anyway, so that's a Humanity knows Alex's feelings or ZK MI's feelings about humanity. So here's a bone to pick with humanity. He hates the idea he doesn't believe. Because you have to understand that Zkme had always, again, for context. He gave me had always prided themselves on vanity metrics. And their key vanity metric was number of what they used to call attestations that had been done, which for them meant verified identity profiles. And they would celebrate past. They celebrated passing a hundred thousand attestations, 250,000 attestations, 500,000 attestations. The last time I believe they published a number they had just passed, or it was nearing a million attestations. They hate this idea that humanity protocol went from 0 to 10 million, quote unquote profiles near overnight. Without help. So they've been going after humanity for this 10 million number forever. This 88% fraud flagging thing. I have no idea where this comes from. Now, as you rightly pointed out, We know humanity extremely well. We obviously are no longer actually partners in humanity. As you well know, we ended our relationship with humanity at the end of 2025 because they decided to go to a centralized identity stack. But we know all of the ongoings of humanity throughout. I think from everything we know, We wouldn't. We? We do not. I mean, we think this at 80% bot number. The number is definitely not zero. But an 80% bot number is absolutely ridiculous. Because we know that the vast majority of these folks are real people, real wallets, because not only do they own tokens, they trade tokens. And they're very active in the Humani community. The community is very, very active. Now as a platform. Our position is we will do what we can. For fraud detection. If we are in control of the front end. And that is exactly what we did when we, at one point, control the front end for humanity's onboarding. We put in a lot of bot detection. We did a lot. Including waiting rooms and a bunch of Vercel stuff. And in fact, there actually was a big blow up with humanity at one point because Al Vercel integration kind of failed us. And there was a huge traffic spike which would clearly bots for like, nothing. How long was that? Like 24 hours, maybe less than that. And then. Yeah, and then we had to scramble the entire engineering team to fix it. So we took that very, very seriously. They eventually took over the onboarding. Onboarding process and whatnot. What they've done since then. We have no control over because our platform just does. The, you know, the. The. The actual identity issuance. Based on identity data that is submitted from them. And so once. We actually have zero transparency. At this point into what their user base looks like and whatnot. And as as identity infrastructure in this situation, Because. Especially because we did not control, you know, like, we certainly did not control the entire onboarding stack. It's not our responsibility. This is again for context. If we get to the nuts and bolts of this. Jan, you'll need one of the founders to be able to get on a call with Lorenzo and whomever else to address this, you know, with veracity. And with, you know, details. With detail, okay? But everything that we know. Gives us confidence to say that humanity is not like majority bot activity. So it's not a. It is not. It's not a fraud. But at the same time, and most importantly infrastructure partner, the issuance of the identities. And the issuance of the initial and early credentials. And so actual, you know, bot detection and all of that stuff really is the responsibility of the client. And the scenario. Okay, because now that that does not include the KYC stuff, obviously QIC is on our side. Right with humanity. The vast majority of the identities that have been issued and the credentialing that they've used using our infrastructure, that they should use infrastructure is not KYC stuff. So therefore it's not like that there was KYC fraud on Ashlag. Does that make sense? 0% kyc. Okay. There's been no KYC done with humanity, so there's no chance of KYC fraud or stuff on our side for that. Okay? Before we move on from before we go to next action for Zkme and humanity protocol. Are there any clarifying questions that either Ahmed or Jan want to ask about these two third parties? And our relationships with them. Jan, you're muted.    
Me: Yeah, I think majority fully aligned with pretty much everything you said. The only question I might have is we did have some bots. If I am messaging him later, I think there were two points that he addressed when it came to Zkme on what they said. Right. There were two allegations. One is a dispute and then the cause of the dispute itself, which is, I don't know, 88% bots. We might want to provide a clarification statement that. 's. Yeah. I don't know. I'm just trying to figure out how to articulate it, but, yes, I think we can figure that out.    
Them: Hey, Malcolm. Yeah, Malcolm, can you clarify? I know that again, we obviously have that Vercel issue. But technically speaking, Where do the responsibility of fraud detection? And anti fraud, anti civil activities. Sit. Was it on them or is it on us? Because I seem to remember that it was actually on them. We put in the versailles controls as a secondary measure. It's both, right, because we also provide some prop protection on our side. The first cell, of course, offers their own bot protection as well. Okay, so can you clarify that point a little bit more? Right, like from a. Yeah. So, for example, some of the things that we offer for bot protection would be recaptcha. So we install recaptcha as part of that. We also, of course, do things like email verification and, you know, making sure that people are real human, whereas Vercel controls bot protection from a networking like perspective. So if they notice that the site is being hammered by certain IITs at a certain frequency, So they would, you know, protect against that type of bot attached. And in particular, when. When Vercel went down, It was. It was because it was almost like a DDoS type of thing where because there was some sort of claim. On the site. So it was an automated bot attack, you know, obviously an automated bot attack, because you can actually see, or at least for a cell can see a flood of traffic, you know, on certain, like, IP addresses. Got it. And so what is the accurate statement here is that technically, Vercel was managed services through us, but it was really their front end, so they controlled. That's why we had to go through their team to decide on all of the thresholds for Roselle. So humanity had decision making. I mean, it was their decision. To make on the vercel side. I'll recapture the waiting room. All of that stuff was our secondary measures to protect against bioactivity. And we took that and obviously email confirmation that we took that all very, very seriously. There was only that one incident that we are aware of, where that third party Vercel, went down. And there was a short. Period of like it was the DDoS attack or it looked like the DDoS attack. Short period of activity. Which we flagged, and then we sent all of those accounts that came in during that period of time. To humanity. For their processing. Besides that. There is no other evidence that we have of, you know, like a significant or continued bot activity, right? Yeah, that's correct, I think. I mean, you know, first and foremost, like, every site has bots, right? So that's it. Full stop. Every site. We, of course, did everything that was in our power to actually provide bot protection. In fact, we provide extra services such as the waiting room and whatnot. Typical websites, don't. Even employ. We use, you know, technologies, various different technologies, including ones you know from Google, let's say from Captcha. And then you're right in that Diversell piece was mainly managed in collaboration with humanity. What humanity was the ones that's making some of the decisions, the architectural decisions or configuration decisions. On how to configure the cell. And in fact, the reason why the initial attack happened, the reason why the initial downtime happened, is because of the way that they had it set up as a reverse proxy into herself. So it was actually against Vercel's suggested method, but humanity specifically wanted it that way. And so that's why it went down the beginning. Yeah, but then obviously that ended up being corrected so that we could plug the hole. So it's important to understand that Vercel is. Gracel is effectively managed service. So it was in the inhumanities control, it was their decision making, but. But it was managed services by Terminal3 3\. Jan. Does that make sense?    
Me: Yeah, that makes sense. I think what I'm hearing is we basically say that all the allegations are baseless, and if at all. I don't know if we want to get into the incident details, but we can say that, in fact, if there have been any incidents, we've ensured that, in fact, added additional bot protection services to actually strengthen bots from creating identities for bots.    
Them: Yeah.    
Me: Something along those lines.    
Them: Yeah. I'll work with you on the messaging. We'll keep it short and tight, but, yes, that's effectively what we're going to say is that it's baseless. We're not going to get into the incident details. We will, in the message back to Lorenzo, we will have, with strong conviction, articulate that there is no legal like Terminal3 3 has, has no ongoing legal dispute. With Zkme. We have. We've never had any commercial relationship or overlapping partner relationships. With Zkme. What we do know about Zkme is that they do regularly use corporate misinformation, a competitive misinformation, as a. As a tactic. And that both Terminal3 3 and Humanity Protocol, both of which are also happen to be Hong Kong based companies, along with ckme, have been their targets. Multiple times in the past, which is why we also don't engage with them. And then on the Humanity Protocol side, very, very short message to say in our time, in the 18 months that we provided service that, you know, Humanity Protocol with Client Terminal3 3 was very ardent. About fraud and bot detection and anti civil methods. And we feel very confident standby what we did for them. And we do not believe, and we do not believe in any way that that we do not believe that humanity protocol is majority bots or fraud at all.    
Me: There's one. I think while we were having this call, he sent out the email. Malcolm, you've been cc'd in it as well. Let me just share my screen quickly, maybe.    
Them: Or just forward it? Just forward it to us so we can read it on our own phones right now.    
Me: Just. It.    
Them: Okay, give me one second. Oh, this was that. This was that really stupid interview. It wasn't even interview. Terrence called a guy who had been aggravating him. Didn't know that he was being recorded. No, no, no. This is. This is. Okay, this is nonsense. Verified versus unverified is not the same as bots. So, malcolm. Are you reading this? Yeah, yeah. Y. Eah. I would say. Yeah. So I would say that the answer to this. Would be. Would be. Here's what we did for humanity. And here's all the protections that were in place. Throughout. To make sure that people coming into the funnel and the identities issued by, and only very clearly by Terminal3 3\. Were, you know, like, we're humans, right? So everything you just said, let's make sure we put it all down. And the response. And then the second point we'd make. Is also note that you know, saying that that a million users are verified. Meaning, you know, KYC or biometric verified. And in some way is not the same as saying all the others are bots. That's the second. Second point that you want to make. There. Okay. User figure is the 10 million. Yeah, let's. Let's break down our 10 million. To the customers that we've had, the vast majority of which 9 million is humanity protocol. And then we have the open campus and then the other users. So let's, let's transparently share that with them. On open campus. Yeah. Malcolm, if you can provide Jan a short statement on our previous partnership with Open Campus, what we provided to them, how they used us. What do you think we should. How should we address the fact that they're no longer a customer? I think we just said that they're no longer custom. To say that the when did the when did the commercial relationship with the men. December. Yeah. End of December. So as of January 1st. Really? Yeah. So both humanity and open campus ended in December of 2025\. To say that. For IP and legal. Joey, the only ongoing legal thing is the trademark, right where UK trademark in the US Terminal3 3 trademark. Okay. Yep. So if you can write out a very simple one liner that we've always been transparent about and all about DD documents. And then customer references. I will give a call right now. He knows to expect a call from me. The two things that I'm going to speak to him about is, number one, is this bot claim. And that if that, I will ask. First of all, I'll ask him to be one of our references. And then he can. He can. You know, he will be very good as a reference, even though he's no longer a client. He'll explain exactly why, and there won't be an issue for them for Metamask. But second of all, I'll ask him to more directly address the bot issue with with MetaMask in a way that not only absolves US responsibility, but makes Metamax aware that. That. Yeah, that this should be a non issue. Other customers. Joey. Malcolm, what are your thoughts here? I think we could. I think at this point we would be able to ask Imda. The Singapore Regulator. Somebody there? To provide a reference. On why we are working on a pilot together. So I can work with Charmaine to try and get that. Get that. Get. Get something from Imda. Do you guys have any other suggestions for a potential third? We used to use Open Campus. I don't know at this point whether or not we want to.    
Me: How about dnp?    
Them: Oh, of course. Silly me, yes. Let me work with charmaine on both the dmp and imda references. I think if we needed more, I could ask Jona to provide a reference from up with Campus. But as of now, unclear if that's more of a positive or neutral thing. In the references. We specifically mentioned that he values references from regulated use cases. We've not closed Idaos in yet, but. Again. I think we're very close. Will it be too early to ask for a reference from. From Sean? I think so. I think it'd be way too early. We don't even. Yeah. Yeah, it'd be way too early for that. I think that getting a Singapore regulator, if we can get IMDA to write any kind of reference on why they're working with us for a pilot, and we will frame it as that. And then with dmp. Why we have a deepening technical relationship and are issuing what is regulated. Like these are regulated KYC credentials. Into for Japan, use that. That should be enough.    
Me: Another reference, but just a suggestion. Does it make sense for Nathan as well? Because he does come from IMD.    
Them: No, he works. He works. He works for us.    
Me: Yeah. I mean, he works for us, but the fact moved.    
Them: Doesn't matter. Doesn't matter. At this point, he's a college of interest. Trust me. If. If this had been, you know, a month ago and he hadn't announced that he was joining Terminal3 3, absolutely. We get him to write something as a former digital lead of imda, but at this point, there's conflict of interest. Okay, so. All right, so we. We now have action items for at least this email. And who owns what. I will work with Jan specifically on just a very short message that will go back and text to Lorenzo separately. I will jump on a call with Terrence at Humanity Protocol, and I'll try to get Sean from consensus on a call. Actually, I'm going to call Sean first. Because it's late down the east coast, so I'm going to try and call him now. And then any other action items that we're supposed to take.    
Me: The idos bullets on. Why we're better.    
Them: Yes. Yes. Can I leave that to Jan and Malcolm? You guys, to a deep dive. On idos and do a direct competitive analysis. Here's the focus. They're focused on the platform. Fee issue. So what we need to focus on is the future state. Not just kyc. Kyc is commodity. So what we need to focus on is why do we charge a platform fee? What is the advantage? And the advantage is of course, all of those other pieces of what happens when you have to like when you have live data, access to user data. So it's not just singular self custody claims that are snapshot of a moment. But rather, it's a. It's, you know, it's a fake. Credentials, like everything you can do with smart credentials that you cannot do with a, with a, you know, a snapshot self custody credential. Sounds good. Okay? So focus on that. As the justification for the platform fee. Okay, so let's pull all of this together as quickly as possible. Joey, can you coordinate assembling all of this? And then we want to do a full review of our responses. All three of the responses. The text response. Just to make sure that no one has an issue with it. The email response spectralizer with all of these points. And then finally, the competitive analysis response. Versus idos. Any last things. Okay, cool. Let's get to work. Thank you, everyone. All right. Thank you. Thank you, everyone. Bye.

Meeting Title: Product Kickoff: Transak \<\> MetaMask \<\> Terminal 3  
Date: Feb 9  
Meeting participants: Amit Rath, Lorenzo Santos, Will Dixon

Transcript:  
   
Me: Hello? Hello?    
Them: Hello. Morning. We're good. Evening.    
Me: Good morning. To.    
Them: How's your weekend?    
Me: A very restful, actually didn't do much, but was just catching up on a lot of stuff. My dad was on, well recently, so things were pretty chaotic on my side. So just like a lot of backlog, like personal backlog to tend to.    
Them: Hope he's feeling better. I know how difficult that could be when a parent isn't well.    
Me: And he's doing much better now. He had a procedure where tease recovering well. So I think things have, like, settled down finally. We. Had someone. Hey, amit. Very nice.    
Them: Nice to meet you. Too. Yes, Lorenzo, tell me like.    
Me: Is there anybody else joining as well?    
Them: No, it will be just me for today. So what I want to understand is exactly what do we have in mind? How do we want to take this forward? And based on that, probably I can add more people from our end in prospective calls.    
Me: Sure. Absolutely. Maybe I'll start with a round of introduction from myself. So, hi, I'm Jan. I am from Terminal3 3 and I'm a product manager here at Terminal3 3\. I'm sure Lorenzo might have already briefed you quite a bit, but essentially, Terminal3 3 offers decentralized infrastructure, including reusable. KYC as one of our solutioning and we base it out of global standards for verifiable credentials. And that's one of the reasons we would also collaborating with Metamask the two factors to KYC is its privacy preserving in nature. And we kind of take off the PII headache for most of the companies that we work with. And secondly, the bigger value is the reusability of user doing KYC once and then that verifiable credential being passable. And the biggest value add for that is KYC is a necessary evil. Most drop offs happen during KYC before a product can be used. So we essentially take that friction off, and that is the hope that we also want to bring as value to Metamask. And eventually, of course, to Transak as well. So we are starting off with the integration with Transak, as Lorenzo has really spoken highly off the transact flow, and we felt like that might be the most suitable one to start off with. And in the future, essentially, there are KYCs done to other providers within Metamask. That will also add double the value to Transak, with the reusable KYC verifiable credential being passed to you itself. That is a brief about me and the product. Very happy to go into details. And that's what I would love to use a call for as well. But before I proceed, I would love to hear about you as well.    
Them: Yeah, sure, sure. So, I'm Amit. I have been with Transak for, like, almost four years now. Primarily take care of Frontier. And like, as of now, predominantly take care of the Fiat and order team. But then, more or less, I'm involved in all the bigger projects and all the major product areas. We are, like, you know, expanding the team. So, like, I'm hiring. But, yeah, that's how it is as of now. We have been working with Metamask since very long, in fact. I think we are the first on prem provider on MetaMask, one of the first. And the second. Oh, the second. Okay, yeah. So the second one, and now I think in Metamask is also changing the strategy to a great extent. And like we have signed an exclusive deal. To help them build out a native on RAM flow on Metamask itself. So that's how Transak and Metamask work together. And this. This came to life in September last year. So since then, like we are working even more closely. Earlier we were like, you know, only on the aggregator and the portfolio DAP. Now it's like MetaMask is powering a native rams experience via Transak. Transak. If you're aware, we are an onofram provider. We're in the market since very long now. Started in 2019\. You know, like seeing this market, like, all the cycles, et cetera. And we ourselves, you know, like, take care of a lot of these things. As you mentioned, KIC is a necessary evil, is something that we also have to do, you know, based on our licenses we have. So we take care of KYC as of so if I have to narrate the entire user journey, it's like authentication. First, then there is kyc, then there is order placement, then payments. Then there is recon, and then risk, and then finally fulfillment. So on top of that, like, liquidity is something additional because we have to manage the tokens as well. Right. And the liquidity on various networks. So, yeah, that's, like, more of. In short, what transact does. Obviously. Metamask is one of the partners we have. We are a B2B 2C application. So, like, there are a lot of partners out there, more than like 3, 350 who have integrated Transak to provide on off ramp to their end customers. We are also slowly and steadily like, you know, kind of like on off ramp is obviously our bread and butter. But then we are focusing on modularizing our entire product suit such that, you know, like Auth kyc Payments, all these things can be offered as separate modules to Web2 clients as well. So we are not just focusing on Web three now, but Web two as well. Because I mean, Web three, like, you know, blockchain is becoming an integral strategy for every web to fintech as well now. Right. So that's basically idea. We are proceeding in that direction. And a lot of these products suits like metamask is already using few of them like they will start using in some time. So yeah, that's.    
Me: Right. No.    
Them: Feel free to ask questions.    
Me: Yeah, no, absolutely. I think that's super helpful as well, just to overall understand your strategy as well. So I think you mentioned the entire kind of flow and the different suite of products. I think where Terminal3 3 really comes in is on the authentication of the user, which is like login authentication, as well, as followed by kyc. We are also in the trajectory of providing risk parameters for different companies have different risk appetites, and we are still in that trajectory. But of course we've started off with various KYSE information or identity information to begin with. Now, how the integration would essentially work, I will just give a rough overview. I also have a bunch of questions, but we can address each other as we move forward. How it would work is we receive a bunch of parameters from Metamask stating amount and I think we needed a triparty alignment as well on how the end to end workflow works. So this is not set in stone. Just an example of potentially how it could work, wherein MetaMask gives some important parameters like amount and certain other parameters like device type or device id, because I heard that that is relevant for risk for computation for Transak as well. And we take that information and we provide the login or authentication mechanism through email, and after that we collect the information we did go through transacts flow and that's what we've based off. Our solution is suite at least and we are happy to improve it further if you feel like there are some drop offs and you want us to improve it and essentially we've based it off of that, so. We recognize that you ask for name, for number, address and SSN for the KYC level one. So more than 150\. Then we go on to KYC level two. And based off of all of this information, we provide a verifiable credential with the parameters of kyc. Now, there are two. Ways to do it. One is we retain all this information and this is how we traditionally prefer to do it. But it differs from provider to provider and client to client requirements and compliance needs really, wherein we hold the PII information in our decentralized storage and we provide you the claim of level of KYC being passed. Now, you can use that verifiable credential. It's a mathematically provable I mean, it's a cryptographically provable verifiable credential. And we also issue a verifier SDK. So it's a simple implementation of just verifying the verifiable credential that we sent to you. That is method number one. Now, method number two is you want PII data, because that is how you've been processing and essentially maintaining and starting off on ramp next steps, in which case we will provide the limited information that you definitely need without any compromise. Like something that your risk or compliance team say, hey, no, we have to store this data, then we are happy to provide those fields and retain the remaining fields as well. So for example, if you don't need address from the passport, oftentimes it's not required for a limited transaction amount. So even though that detail comes out of the OCR of a passport. So we can just provide the name, date of birth and retain the passport. Other aspects of the details and selectively disclose only the aspects that you require, again via verifiable credential. Where exactly I need a little bit more support is I did see a KYC document. It was, you know, overall, a brief that we understood on how KYC works. But the next steps would be to go into the specifics of exact requirements of KYC for the various jurisdictions that Transak works in. We have our own, just based on global standards. Like what? Binance or like Coinbase. Kind of does, but we are happy to, like, you know, take in your requirements on that and be able to pass that to you as well. So that is basically. So there will be an integration more like a front end input from Metamask site and then we would intend to provide an integration with Transak and happy to do this through a webhook or any other, any other method that you would wish. Ideally, again, we have some preferred or recommendations for how we could potentially integrate. But I'm happy to take the opinion of the team and transact, you know, integration roadmap as well to then accommodate between the teams to then work things out. So the recommended method before me we move on to questions is OID for vp. It's a globally recognized standards for verifiable credentials and for passing data securely. And we have piloted this with clients, which is like now slowly developing standard, but it's also recognized in various parts of the world. So that is basically what the recommendation is. But that said, if you prefer, you know, more traditional API and webhook methods of data transfer, that will be a little bit more complex given these are verifiable credentials. But. But we can work what's. What's convenient.    
Them: Got it. Got it. Visual. Thanks. Thanks for giving this explanation. Quick points based on, you know, whatever you have just mentioned. One is like, probably, you know, we have to obviously discuss with Lorenzo and how Lorenzo is thinking about the end to end experience. Right. I think that would be the starting point of us, like, then deep diving, hashing out the flow, and then figuring out exactly how different things would work out. So that is one. Probably. Lorenzo, whenever you're done with breakfast. Probably. You can give us some idea on how you are visualizing the end to end flow, right? From your perspective. How would like Terminal3 3 come into the journey for which all specific steps? Then where does the handover to transact happen and what all world metamask take care of? So let's talk about that in detail so that we can hash things out that we won. Second, you know, I totally understand exactly how you do Kyc. And, you know, like, you would want. To be the sole owner of the PA user PI data and then pass on the very like these credits, if I may call it.    
Me: Sure.    
Them: Right.    
Me: Yeah.    
Them: User creds too, like any other partner. See, the problem is twofold. One, for a lot of the downstream services that we use, for example payments, et cetera.    
Me: Y.    
Them: Or like creating a user on like whenever we are creating a virtual bank account for a user, et cetera, we would need for sure like, you know, users PI data like first name, last name, sometimes mobile number and billing address and those kind of things. So few of these things are like must haves. We need to have that for sure. Apart from that, like, obviously, based on the licenses we hold for level two kyc, I mean, you know, like, we have to collect users, doc. Plus there has to be a liveness check as well.    
Me: Eah.    
Them: So how would those things be taken care of is like another thing probably we should, you know, deep dive into later. And then there is a third level of KYC as well.    
Me: Absolutely.    
Them: Wherein, you know, we take I think users income proofs and like few other. Yes.    
Me: Source of proof.    
Them: Yes. Few the documents as well. So, again, how would that be taken care of is also, you know, an open point which we can discuss later. Finally the auth bit, right? Again. It all depends on how Lorenzo is thinking about the journey. But then, would you take care of auth Kyc Both? And then like we rely on your Kyc or like, is it like? No, it is Transak who does all these things. But then we will be using Terminal3 3 as a KYC provider. That is something I'm still not clear on. Very frank.    
Me: Okay?    
Them: Probably. You know, like, that is also something that we should, like, figure out or hash out once. Once Lorenzo can give his thought.    
Me: Sure. One thing is we will pass the authentication as well as an authentication data to you as well. We do that for a lot of clients today, so that is basically the same process I'm envisioning. Happy to go into details with your team or the dev team as well, but essentially we can help with authentication and kyc and we are happy to work with any provider. We are provider agnostic. So, for example, if you prefer on Fido or I know that currently the flow shows on Fido, but I've also seen documentation that points to sums up. So we are happy to ensure that, you know, we can, we can work with the provider of choice. And that is, that is how that is also how our strategies kind of going to be provided agnostic and fully agreed on the PII data that you require. Like I said, every company has their own risk and compliance rules. But that said, we don't want to explain the technology on why it might not be required and why? From a compliance perspective, you will not need to physically hold this data to be able to do the things that you need to. You will have access in case of a regulatory, enforcement or authority demanding aliveness proof, or be it, you know, proof of the source of passport data document or proof of address document. We have something called the regulatory vault, to which you will be able to provide access to the regulative authorities. So that is how the overall intra works. But yes, like you said, perhaps you can have an initial conversation with Lorenzo on. On the overall strategy for what he's envisioning and happy. To go over anything else that you need from Terminal3 3, and, yeah, we can. We can also take it from there.    
Them: I think to answer the point on user experience, quickly share my screen. These are earlier mocks, but they do a really good job of just showing the overall journey. So we, we do want to use Terminal3 3 for the login and authentication. And this goes back to the main problem that would turn solve. Within Metamask there's already multiple login steps and multiple kyc, so we do want to have banks also use Terminal3 3 for the MetaMask card. And as a part of that, the login system would also be unified. So from the user's perspective, they should only have to log in once, maybe twice. I think depending on how you consider it doing the issue, biometric unlock to get into the wallet could be seen as a login for the user. So, yeah, this is where it would start. So we would have. A within the wallet. That would be the same as it is today, where the user selects the amount. We're getting rid of these quotes now, but at the point that the user selects the white label experience. That's where they would go into the Terminal3 3 experience, starting with this login that creates that decentralized identity. And then from there, based on the amount and what they're going to on ram, to that's where the KYC would come in. And if they need to do the level two, that would happen there and then finally there would be the step where the user would consent to share the credential with Transak. I'm still thinking through how to make sure that we don't have drop off at this stage. But yeah, this is, this is the idea we would have Terminal3 3 come in before we engage with any of the checkout steps for the. For the payment processing. Got it. Makes sense, Jan. Like, can you quickly walk me through exactly how do you guys do login? Like user auth?    
Me: Yeah. So we have multiple methods.    
Them: You're on mute.    
Me: I'm sorry, I was saying that is actually a different team that handles it, but I'll do my best to like take a shot at it. Essentially we have multiple authentication methods. It's similar to your oauth that you would do with Google or as such. But essentially we take that data and we use Lib protocol to essentially encrypt the keys and then store it in a decentralized fashion. But for a user experience, it would work as though, you know, they use any of the other social logins ready that is one. And we also do email authentication, very similar to how Transak currently does it. Wherein the email is input and then we do a OTP verification via just to verify the email. We also wanted to verify the phone number, which is evident in some of the providers that Metamask has. But I did notice that Transacts Flow itself did not have phone verification. That actually comes to one of the questions that I did have. Is that like a conscious choice made by transact to not verify phone? Because we did realize that when a phone number has been entered to one account, if I enter the phone number in another account, I'm not able to log in. So since we're speaking about login, one of the questions we had is, should we do phone number verification as well? Just so someone doesn't, you know, enter. Then you know the wrong person, enter the other person's number.    
Them: A couple of points. One is as of now if you go through our log on on transact itself we support normal email auth plus Google SSO and Apple SSO as well. Both login with Google and Apple is also supported. But primarily since the very start, we only had email authentication. Email was the unique identifier. User could just, you know, authenticate their email via an OTP and receipt. Why phone number authentication was not done. It's basically to, you know, like, boost conversions. That's it. Nothing else. Because it was not a hard requirement. But then, you know, I'm like, the more we think about it, We are going to bring in phone number authentication as well very soon. Because otherwise like it, it becomes very risky for us. Like, there are a lot of fraudulent users. Like, spinning up an email is very easy. But spending of new phone numbers is very expensive, right? So that is the main reason why we want to bring in phone number authentication. And that is why we do not allow duplicate phone numbers as of now. So, yeah, that is something that we want to bring in. Going forward, and it will be like a. Like, great to have. If you guys are also doing phone number authentication. Because, again, like, a verified phone number is also used by, you know, downstream services at times. So for sure makes a lot of sense.    
Me: Absolutely. Actually, that's great to know. And do you normally. How do you identify accounts? Is it through emails? Right, through emails. Is there a plan to do that with phone numbers?    
Them: Yes. Y. Es. Not as of now.    
Me: Okay?    
Them: But then like, yeah, we are flexible. Okay. So the way to think about it is as of now, like I mentioned earlier, it was just email auth. Now we have the social logins as well, but then only two like Google and Apple.    
Me: Okay?    
Them: With, you know, like our strategy of venturing into the Web2Fintech space. We have also recently built out an Auth Reliance product. What that implies is basically we relying on the authentication done by a third party. So for example Terminal3 in this case, or if MetaMask would do their own auth, then we rely on that. So that is also something that we have already created. But then again, like, limitation of that product as of now is like we need to have the user's email.    
Me: Excellent. Okay? Yeah.    
Them: For us to, you know, like, rely on someone's auth.    
Me: That's fair. Y.    
Them: So, yes, like that is something that, you know, in case we are going ahead with this kind of a flow, then probably yes, you guys. Would basically integrate our author lines. And the way it would function is like you are doing users auth. We do a due diligence on you. We sign obviously all the contracts, agreements beforehand.    
Me: Eah.    
Them: And. Basically, you will do B2B authentication. To access any other transact APIs that you might use. So that's how it would function. But yeah, I think the tricky case here is how would Terminal3 3 fit into the entire. Contract, right? Because now there is Metamask, there is Transak, and Transak is the one which is holding all the licenses. So Transact needs to have n number of things to ensure that, you know, we are compliant with local regulations. And then There is Terminal3 3, which is a provider that Metamask would use. For certain services. Right. So we have to figure out, like, exactly how this would be legally binding and compliant at the same time.    
Me: Yeah.    
Them: So for that, probably, yeah, we can, you know, have a discussion with the compliance needs. We can make them talk compliance and legal, and they can figure this out.    
Me: Yeah, I think it's good to anyway start those discussions as well. We've also been asking a bit of compliance advisory on essentially how it would work with the new providers, so I believe I'm not the team to answer that, but I feel like it would be good to anyway start those conversations to ensure that they're able to clarify each other's, you know, questions. Yeah, no, I think that's. That Santos good. I will check online for your Auth Reliance product. I don't think I had a look at the documentation, so I think I will have a look at that.    
Them: Just like Gone Live, I think last week itself.    
Me: Okay, okay, okay, okay, okay. No problem.    
Them: Probably. I think.    
Me: Let me know if you have any documentation around it. I'll ask my team to begin looking at it.    
Them: Yeah. Sure.    
Me: And from my side, I'm actually in the midst. I was just in the midst of finalizing the documentation for PRD to share with Lorenzo, and I will also share, like, a proposal for, you know, potentially how Transak can integrate with. That said, I just want to take a first jab at it. I make the proposal. It just. It does not have to be final. It can be after, of course, maybe. My development team and your development team have also hashed out stuff and just to get things started here and ensure that you know this, this is also valuable to transact.    
Them: Yeah, makes sense. Lorenzo, quick question to you, like, in this entire. Tripartite agreement that we'll have. Who is bearing the cost of authentication and KYC. We would be bearing the cost. Okay? Makes sense.    
Me: Cool. I think in terms of questions, I have a list. Perhaps I'll forward that and we can crunch it offline. They're going to be very specific questions around the KYC and compliance requirements, more so than development related. I do think for development it's better if I gave a written proposal for you to go through and then perhaps, you know, began commenting on it. But. But I think largely I have somewhat explained the end to end flow. Do let me know if you have any questions and feel free to drop me any points at any time as well. Would it be convenient to have a common slack channel between the three of us? Perhaps, as we pursue how we.    
Them: Yes, for sure. Flag would be very convenient. We can, like, obviously, you know, we can talk Async and. Yeah, makes a lot of sense. All of us are in different time zones, so, yes.    
Me: That's true. Like, it's pretty complex, given it's, like, three exact different parts of the world. But no. Thank you so much for your accommodating the schedule. Both Lorenzo and Amit.    
Them: Not an issue. One more thing. Lorenzo question to you. Any ETAs you have in mind, like by when you want this to go live? And then. Exactly what is the expectation? As well, like, I'll ask you a few questions now, but then first, let's start with like a go live eta. Probably a tentative date so that, you know, we can, like, think about this whole thing accordingly, plan it out. Yep. I'm also working on a PRD as well. The ideal day as of now is April. April 16th is what I put here. As one of the builds that would give us enough time to buffer in any. Any changes. And then the scope within that and issue build would be US EU transact only and so the. So the white label experience on mobile and then later in the quarter don't have a date for this, but would want to follow up with the bank's integration as well. I think that's where this program really comes to life, is when you have two experiences within MetaMask, have that seamless onboarding. Yeah, makes sense. Okay. So I think, yeah, 16th April seems like a good date. I mean, in the sense we'll have decent time to hash things out and work together. The way I see it. Like majority of the heavy lift needs to be done by Terminal3 3\. Then followed by Metamask. And then least amount of lift needs to be done from Transak. Like that's how. Like this is my first intuition. But yeah, probably once. Once we watch this out even more. We get a better sense of, you know, how much work is involved for each of the parties.    
Me: I do think that's the right intuition. Amit, I do anticipate the verifier SDK is super easy to implement I believe for new users, which is what we would be going to market with. We will first test that out and then we can also see if we can improve anything for the existing users flow across MetaMask as well. Where of course, I think that we will do is like a face to a phase three, perhaps.    
Them: Yeah, so. You've raised a good point. This is exactly what I was going to ask Lorenzo. If you remember the last time we were having this discussion, sometime in December. I had told you. Right. Like. As of now, the way to visualize this is there are an existing set of users that are already metamask users that are already KYC by Transak plus let's say all these other aggregators like our competitors. Plus all the different product lines that you have, like the cards and all those kind of things, right? So there are an existing set of users, and then, like, the new users would come in. Right. So how are you thinking about this? To start with on 16th of April. You only want to ensure the new KYCS and new user onboardings happen via Terminal3 3\. Or like you want something to happen with existing users as well. Like, how are you thinking about it? So new users for the first release. And then I do have user migration as like a V1 one on the phase rollout. Trying to remember, Jan, what we discuss. I think we said it made more sense to have it have be like one at a time. As the users start to interact, we would move their KYC over. So yeah, I think user migration should be handled separately from the initial integration of having the new user experience. With Terminal3 3\.    
Me: That is absolutely right. Also, for the existing users, we could create a verifiable credential over the data that Transak has instead of having the users to read okc. Since we are provide diagnostic, we will be able to do it. Or we might have to work very closely with the provider that was used to perform those KYCs. But that said, we don't have to make the users go through the brunt of KYC again or cause conversion disruptions. There.    
Them: Okay, so Jan, quick point here. So we have just gone live with Author Lines very soon. We are also going live with Kyc Reliance. And what KYC reliance implies. So as of now, we do have KYC reliance, but that is only via sumsub. So let's say Terminal3 3 uses sums up two KYC and end user. Then you can simply share the sums up token with us. And you know we rely on the KYC and proceed. So that's how we.    
Me: No, sorry, sorry.    
Them: Yeah. So that's how we do KYC Reliance via Sumsub. But then that is very restrictive in nature, right, because we are forcing the partner to only tie up with one KYC vendor. So now the second version of it is, wherein we are opening it up for any provider. We are making a provider agnostic. How it will work out is obviously a due diligence of your processes. The compliance teams will be, you know, like, have a big checklist that they would go through, ensure, like, you know, data security standards. All those things are in perfect shape. Fine. And based on that, like, we signed some agreement. And then. Every time like you do a KYC. What you can do is simply call our APIs and share like the personal details, address details. SSNF required and the doc and Liveness photos or videos. Those things we can hash out if you can just share all those things. That's it. And then, you know, we rely on your KYC and we proceed. That is also something that is going to go live very soon. That is also something probably we can discuss.    
Me: Okay?    
Them: Verify SDK that you are talking about? Yes. It Santos like a great product. But then again, like I am not 100% sure. What would our compliance say to that? Probably they might be okay with it also. I'm not sure, but, yeah, probably. I think we should ensure the compliance team speak to each other once so that, you know, like, our compliance can also let you know beforehand, like, exactly what all we would need.    
Me: Yeah. Sure.    
Them: Right. Because at the end of the day, it is our licenses which are used for the user doing on ramp, right?    
Me: Me? Absolutely.    
Them: So if, if the licenses say that, you know, we need to have these user details with us, and obviously we would need that, probably simply the VERIFY SDK would not work. But then if, like, this is not a hard requirement, then yes, like, the very first D gig might work.    
Me: Have a copy. Yeah. Just to quickly. Just two points over that. One is verify. SDK is only to verify whether the verifiable credential that you've gotten is actually relevant. That is, if the signer signing the verifiable credential, for example, if you're using sums up as a provider. And we've derived the details from sums up to basically put together that verifiable credential, then is that really coming from the right KYC vendor source? So that is what the verifier SDK does. But then the verifiable credential that is passed is the one that will have the PII data, whichever that your compliance needs, and you will be able to store that. But just there's just that. It's the same just that you take with storing data today, but we're just advising against it because this is the approach towards KYC that globally different companies are taking. Primarily because of, well, GDPR laws. And there is a lot of, well, you know, trouble that comes from storing PII data. One more thing is we are in the midst. I was just telling Lorenzo this the other day. We're still in the midst of finalizing stuff with sums up. We're not yet. I mean we want to be provide diagnostic. But that said, we are still in the midst of finalizing things. So one thing that I do want to add is we've had a very lengthy conversation with sums up some subs token product right now they copy physical stores of data and that is also not exactly secure and the token is not something that is reusable for liveness check for example, but something that's very useful, or rather the technology of cryptography really helps as a mathematical proof is that Liveness is also possible. And this actually complies with most laws that's required at least within US and eu. That was the two jurisdictions I at least prioritized to check, as well as several countries in APAC where we have clients today. So mostly like 98% sure that compliance teams should not have a problem, but that said, you know, every company is different and every company's risk exposure is different. We understand that and happy to, you know, hash this out, I guess, with them.    
Them: Sure, sure, for sure. Probably we can ensure the teams meet once. Probably you can share like your proposal once I'll ask my to go through it. And then we can do a follow up call. Wherein the compliance. You can talk about this specifically. On how things can be worked out and post that. I think, yeah, like, it will be very easy for us to hash things out and take this forward.    
Me: Absolutely no. Santos good. I just wanted to say that I'm out of office because it's Chinese New Year holidays here in Singapore. So I will be available after the 19th of February. So I will try to ask the team to send something by this week, but worst case, I might send you something by the 20th. Of February, which is two weeks from now.    
Them: That's totally fine. I mean, I. We are actually not in a hurry to move on, do this. But, yeah, I think the sooner Lorenzo wants to try this, I mean, we are open to, you know, Have bandwidth for this. And out again, like till March 31\. Our like roadmap is kind of cland and I'm not so sure like how we fit few of these things in the roadmap. So probably once. Once we, you know, hash out all these things, I think we'll also be in a better space to let you know. How much time can it take for us? But again, like I mentioned, based on like, the first conversation does not seem like it would take more than two sprints. But then again, like, I need to see your docs and everything and only then like, I'll be able to comment.    
Me: Yeah, yeah.    
Them: More. But let's see.    
Me: Yeah, let me try to send it asap. Or at least ask someone from the team to be able to send it to you. Earlier than that. And no, but I do think on the whole with whichever other clients that we worked with with regards to verification so far it's been a light lift. But yeah, it also depends sometimes on the way architecture is built in some companies, so makes sense. I will definitely share the details you need and yeah, let's start the Slack channel so we can also keep the conversations moving. There.    
Them: Y. Eah. And then finally, like, just one point because you touched on it. I mean, we are SOC to compliant ourselves and we have been storing PI data since the start company, right? So like these, these are the things that we have been doing. So it's like a very easy lift for us. So, I mean, yeah, we are. It should not be a challenge for us to, you know, like, accept PI data, store it properly, securely. Just, like, spread out a lot.    
Me: Absolutely no sh. I think the value prop that we are trying to say is that you do not need that compliance headache. And reusability as a concept just helps, not just with, well, PII headaches, but it's also, it also helps with the overall value for the flow and so that you know your users don't have to go through the difficulty of it. But yeah, we can definitely have more conversations in length as well. I would love to learn a little bit more. I'm relatively new to the crypto world, but I'm still kind of getting acquainted, especially so we'd love to have conversations around how it works on On Ramp and how how Transak works. As well, so. Yeah, but it's super nice meeting you today.    
Them: Yes, same here. Obviously, we'll be in touch. Probably. We can start with the Slack channel creation. And probably once you send out the proposal, the next step could be like compliance, legal kind of a meet wherein we first figure out like how tripartite agreement would be done and what, what all clause will we put, et cetera, et cetera. And then probably we can create a roadmap for this. And. And then, you know, divide the tasks on each of the parties. And take it from there properly.    
Me: Sure. Santos good.    
Them: Yeah, I got the Slack channel going already. I think, Amit, you joined. So, Jan, if you could check on your side. Might need your tech ops team. Allow an external connection. So, yeah, we can keep the ball rolling there. And then on the legal side, the Consensys legal team has already started thinking about the trip party agreement. And has been going back and forth with Terminal3 3\. So I feel pretty good that we probably answered a lot of the questions there. And yeah, ultimately I think the way we should be thinking about this is that it's KYC reliance from the MetaMask Terminal3 3 side onto Transak. So I think the like main nuance here is early. Are you getting some of those sensitive data points and I think as Jan mentioned that it is valuable. To not have the data risk. I think it's far too common for companies to have data breaches, especially in the crypto space. So being able to go to market first and say that metamask and transact protect user data. When you're on ramping into the space should really help improve trust across the board. So I think that's a really important milestone for us to strive for. But yeah, the first one is just removing the friction from the app so that users can do more metamask without having to keep running into kyc. And I think if we do that, Then the business is going to be really happy and everyone's going to make a lot of money. So, yeah, let's make it happen. Yep. Totally agree. Cool. All right. We can call it there. See you on slack. Cool. Thanks, guys. Have a good time.    
Me: Thank you so much. Have a lovely day ahead. By.    
Them: Thank you. Have a good evening.
