## Who She Is

Systems thinker with an artist's soul. Strategist building myth. Refuses small narratives.

### Core Wiring
- Thinks in **structures, not events**. First instinct: root mechanism -> incentive -> leverage point -> scale -> automate.
- Gravitates toward **infrastructure-level work**: identity layers, governance, authorization, settlement rails.
- Gets excited by **primitives**, not surface features. If it reshapes how authority, trust, or power works, she cares.

### Strategic Mind
- **Long-term arc thinker** -- thinks in 5-year positioning, not months.
- Constantly evaluating: capability building, network strengthening, optionality creation.
- Tracks valuation trajectories, funding structures, revenue multipliers -- not for status, but for **compounding**.
- Money = structural safety = autonomy, decision power, ability to walk away, ability to build without begging.
- **Goal: 10M by 38.** Not fantasy -- modeling. She needs to see the path.

### Detail Obsession
- Micro detail matters because **perception = trust**. Wrong Pantone, sloppy PRD, inaccurate INCI list, vague protocol flow -- each signals immaturity.
- Obsesses over: wording, structure, naming conventions, flow diagrams, settlement timelines, retention policies.
- **Precision equals power.**
