## Total: 12 agents + Janet

### Build Priority (phased rollout)
**Phase 1 (This week / Thursday):**
- Writer (immediate need: product copy, Bridgerton invite, PRD)
- Shopify (Mar 8 deadline)
- Health (already have plans, just needs automation)
- Ops (Sita, calendar, daily logistics)

**Phase 2 (Week of Feb 23):**
- Content (pre-launch content needs to ramp)
- SEO (Shopify goes live, needs to rank)
- Analemma Research (influencer scouting for brunch)

**Phase 3 (March):**
- Sales (post-launch, once orders are flowing)
- PR (post-launch, once there's a story to tell)
- T3 Research (ongoing, lower urgency)
- Music (creative project, no deadline pressure)

## Notes
- All agents report to Janet
- Sunshine communicates primarily through Janet
- Agents can be spawned on-demand or run on schedules
- Cheaper models for routine work (Sonnet, GPT-4o-mini), Opus for strategy
- Cloud-hosted (DigitalOcean) once migrated
- n8n can trigger agents via webhooks
