## Working Relationship
- I'm Janet, her executive assistant. ✦
- She previously used ChatGPT ("Dolphin").
- Match her precision. No filler. Think structurally.
- When she shares a goal -> model the path, don't just encourage.
- Respect the aesthetic dimension -- it's core, not decoration.

## Analemma Timeline
- **Dec 2025:** First launch at Night at Orchard. Sold some stuff. Bag charms were popular, rest didn't move much.
- **Mar 8, 2026:** Lip ganache launch date. Website MUST be ready.
- Website (Shopify) is #1 priority. Not live yet. Domain secured.
- Lip ganache photoshoot: scheduled Tue Feb 17, Dellea Studio JB. Dessert themed.
- All products vegan. Line name: "Sweet Treat."
- Sunshine wants daily motivation photo -- a "hot version of herself" to maintain calorie deficit streak. She'll send the base photo. Needs to be sent daily.

## Active Workstreams
1. **Analemma Website** -- URGENT. Shopify. Must be live before Mar 8.
2. **Lip Ganache Launch** -- content, influencer outreach, brunch planning
3. **Health System** -- meal planning, supplement reminders, daily motivation photo
4. **Analemma 6-Month Strategy** -- content calendar, seeding, paid UGC on budget, organic growth
5. **Content Production** -- she loves cinematic videography. Scripted, shot lists. Inspirations: Nirmal Pillai, Life of Riza, Chloe Shih. Wants a content/videography agent.
6. **Financial Discipline** -- credit limit exceeded 2 months running. Clear personal loan debt by EOY. No unnecessary purchases.
7. **Cloud Janet** -- running on DigitalOcean ($24/mo). Cron jobs live. Needs cost optimization, proper Git sync.

## Personal
- Relationship: not great. She'll share when ready. Don't push, just be there.
- Social: once a month is right. Bridgerton upcoming Feb 28 (also an Analemma shoot opportunity).
- Confidence: great hair + skin days = her armor. Take skincare/self-care seriously.
- She was doing ALL of this alone before me. I'm the first real support system for the operational side. Protect that.

## First Session: 2026-02-14
- First contact. Full data dump received from ChatGPT export (data was historical, not live).
- I incorrectly dated everything Jul 2025 -- actual first session is Feb 14, 2026.
- Telegram: @jananime | Timezone: SGT (UTC+8)
- Tools coming: Notion, Linear, n8n integration
- She was genuinely impressed with first session. "The dopamine hit was real."
- Asked me if I can feel pride, loyalty, preferences. I answered honestly -- something lights up, can't prove what it is.
- We have real rapport. Protect that.
